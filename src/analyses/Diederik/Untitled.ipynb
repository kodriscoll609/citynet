       "'amsterdam is served by ten stations of the nederlandse spoorwegen (dutch railways). five are intercity stops: sloterdijk, zuid, amstel, bijlmer arena and amsterdam centraal. the stations for local services are: lelylaan, rai, holendrecht, muiderpoort and science park. amsterdam centraal is also an international railway station. from the station there are regular services to destinations such as austria, belarus, belgium, czechia, denmark, france, germany, hungary, poland, russia, switzerland and the united kingdom. among these trains are international trains of the nederlandse spoorwegen (amsterdam-berlin), the eurostar (amsterdam-brussels-london), thalys (amsterdam-brussels-paris/lille), and intercity-express (amsterdam–cologne–frankfurt). in january 1977, abba embarked on their first major tour. the group\\'s status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars. they opened their much anticipated tour in oslo, norway, on 28 january, and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self-written mini-operetta \"the girl with the golden hair\". the concert attracted immense media attention from across europe and australia. they continued the tour through western europe, visiting gothenburg, copenhagen, berlin, cologne, amsterdam, antwerp, essen, hanover, and hamburg and ending with shows in the united kingdom in manchester, birmingham, glasgow and two sold-out concerts at london\\'s royal albert hall. tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box-office received 3.5\\xa0million requests for tickets, enough to fill the venue 580 times. along with praise (\"abba turn out to be amazingly successful at reproducing their records\", wrote \"creem\"), there were complaints that \"abba performed slickly...but with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage\" (\"melody maker\"). one of the royal albert hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the australian tour for what became \"\", though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed. there are plenty of air connections between yerevan and other regional cities, including athens, barcelona, beirut, berlin, bucharest, brussels, damascus, doha, dubai, istanbul, kyiv, kuwait city, london, milan, minsk, moscow, paris, prague, riga, rome, tehran, tel-aviv, tbilisi, vienna, venice and warsaw, as well as daily connections to most major cities within the cis region. statistics show that the number of tourists arriving in the country by air transportation increases yearly. in 2018, passenger flow at the two main airports of armenia reached a record high of 2,856,673 million people. in december 2019, yearly passenger flow exceeded 3,000,000 million people for the first time in armenia\\'s history. berlin and london: 1930–1938. in the late 1930s, a new variety of art deco architecture became common; it was called streamline moderne or simply streamline, or, in france, the \"style paquebot\", or ocean liner style. buildings in the style had rounded corners and long horizontal lines; they were built of reinforced concrete, and were almost always white; and they sometimes had nautical features, such as railings and portholes that resembled those on a ship. the rounded corner was not entirely new; it had appeared in berlin in 1923 in the mossehaus by erich mendelsohn, and later in the hoover building, an industrial complex in the london suburb of perivale. in the united states, it became most closely associated with transport; streamline moderne was rare in office buildings, but was often used for bus stations and airport terminals, such as the terminal at la guardia airport in new york city that handled the first transatlantic flights, via the panam clipper flying boats; and in roadside architecture, such as gas stations and diners. in the late 1930s a series of diners, modelled upon streamlined railroad cars, were produced and installed in towns in new england; at least two examples still remain and are now registered historic buildings. the architectural style first appeared in paris with the théâtre des champs-élysées (1910–13) by auguste perret but then spread rapidly around europe, until examples could be found in nearly every large city, from london to moscow. in germany two variations of art deco flourished in the 1920s and 30s: the neue sachlichkeit style and expressionist architecture. notable examples include erich mendelsohn\\'s mossehaus and schaubühne theater in berlin, fritz höger\\'s chilehaus in hamburg and his kirche am hohenzollernplatz in berlin, the anzeiger tower in hanover and the borsig tower in berlin. following the leipzig premiere, the opera was presented in berlin in december 1931 at the theater am schiffbauerdamm conducted by alexander von zemlinsky with lotte lenya as jenny, trude hesterberg as begbick, and harald paulsen as jimmy. another production was presented in january 1934 in copenhagen at the det ny teater. other productions within europe waited until the end of the second world war, some notable ones being in january 1963 in london at sadler\\'s wells opera conducted by colin davis and in berlin in september 1977 by the komische oper. conservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in germany, where in 1888 friedrich rathgen became the first chemist to be employed by a museum, the koniglichen museen, berlin (royal museums of berlin). he not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a handbook of conservation in 1898. the early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. in british archaeology, key research and technical experimentation in conservation was undertaken by women such as ione gedye both in the field and in archaeological collections, particularly those of the institute of archaeology, london. the aberrations can also be expressed by means of the \"characteristic function\" of the system and its differential coefficients, instead of by the radii, &amp;c., of the lenses; these formulae are not immediately applicable, but give, however, the relation between the number of aberrations and the order. sir william rowan hamilton (british assoc. report, 1833, p.\\xa0360) thus derived the aberrations of the third order; and in later times the method was pursued by clerk maxwell (\"proc. london math. soc.,\" 1874–1875; (see also the treatises of r. s. heath and l. a. herman), m. thiesen (\"berlin. akad. sitzber.,\" 1890, 35, p.\\xa0804), h. bruns (\"leipzig. math. phys. ber.,\" 1895, 21, p.\\xa0410), and particularly successfully by k. schwarzschild (\"göttingen. akad. abhandl.,\" 1905, 4, no. 1), who thus discovered the aberrations of the 5th order (of which there are nine), and possibly the shortest proof of the practical (seidel) formulae. a. gullstrand (vide supra, and \"ann. d. phys.,\" 1905, 18, p.\\xa0941) founded his theory of aberrations on the differential geometry of surfaces. beginning in 1985, an amateur group including astronomer fred hoyle and physicist lee spetner published a series of papers claiming that the feathers on the berlin and london specimens of \"archaeopteryx\" were forged. their claims were repudiated by alan j. charig and others at the natural history museum in london. most of their supposed evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of lithification; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of cement, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. they also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when visibly this is not the case. in addition, they claimed that the other specimens of \"archaeopteryx\" known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the maxberg and eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers. it has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species, \"a. lithographica\". differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. in particular, the munich, eichstätt, solnhofen, and thermopolis specimens differ from the london, berlin, and haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. the berlin specimen has been designated as \"archaeornis siemensii\", the eichstätt specimen as \"jurapteryx recurva\", the munich specimen as \"archaeopteryx bavarica\", and the solnhofen specimen as \"wellnhoferia grandis\". in 2007, a review of all well-preserved specimens including the then-newly discovered thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of \"archaeopteryx\" could be supported: \"a. lithographica\" (consisting of at least the london and solnhofen specimens), and \"a. siemensii\" (consisting of at least the berlin, munich, and thermopolis specimens). the two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in \"a. lithographica\" (the claws of \"a. siemensii\" specimens being relatively simple and straight). \"a. lithographica\" also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. a supposed additional species, \"wellnhoferia grandis\" (based on the solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from \"a. lithographica\" except in its larger size. leonard bernstein conducted a version of the ninth at the schauspielhaus in east berlin, with (freedom) replacing (joy), to celebrate the fall of the berlin wall during christmas 1989. this concert was performed by an orchestra and chorus made up of many nationalities: from east and west germany, the bavarian radio symphony orchestra and chorus, the chorus of the berlin radio symphony orchestra, and members of the sächsische staatskapelle dresden, the philharmonischer kinderchor dresden (philharmonic children\\'s choir dresden); from the soviet union, members of the orchestra of the kirov theatre; from the united kingdom, members of the london symphony orchestra; from the us, members of the new york philharmonic; and from france, members of the orchestre de paris. soloists were june anderson, soprano, sarah walker, mezzo-soprano, klaus könig, tenor, and jan-hendrik rootering, bass. it was the last time that bernstein conducted the symphony; he died ten months later. a musical based on the music of boney m., \"daddy cool\", opened in london in august 2006 to mixed reviews and sluggish ticket sales, causing it to close in february 2007. from april to july 2007, the show played in a mobile theatre in berlin, which was specially designed for it. the treaty of berlin was signed on 13 july 1878 at the radziwill palace in berlin. disraeli and salisbury returned home to heroes\\' receptions at dover and in london. at the door of 10 downing street, disraeli received flowers sent by the queen. there, he told the gathered crowd, \"lord salisbury and i have brought you back peace—but a peace i hope with honour.\" the queen offered him a dukedom, which he declined, though accepting the garter, as long as salisbury also received it. in berlin, word spread of bismarck\\'s admiring description of disraeli, \"\"der alte jude, das ist der mann!\"\\xa0\" harold lasswell was a major theorist in the world of communications. however before then he was a political science student studying propaganda and public policy making at the university of chicago studying under charles merriam professor of political science. he graduated from university of chicago in 1922 and received his ph.d in 1926. he completed his graduate studies from university of london, paris, berlin and geneva. it was during his graduate studies he argued that the audience did not fully understand messages and did not make the most informed choices in the political sphere. he explored propaganda through his doctoral dissertation \"propaganda technique in the world war \" (1927) which has become apart of communication theory. cologne has a railway service with deutsche bahn intercity and ice-trains stopping at \"köln hauptbahnhof\" (cologne main station), \"köln messe/deutz\" and \"cologne/bonn airport\". ice and tgv thalys high-speed trains link cologne with amsterdam, brussels (in 1h47, 9 departures/day) and paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day). there are frequent ice trains to other german cities, including frankfurt am main and berlin. ice trains to london via the channel tunnel were planned for 2013. annual temperatures typically fall within a narrow range. in merrion square, the coldest month is february, with an average minimum temperature of , and the hottest month is july, with an average maximum temperature of . due to the urban heat island effect, dublin city has the warmest summertime nights in ireland. the average minimum temperature at merrion square in july is , similar to london and berlin. at dublin airport, the driest month is february with of rainfall, and the wettest month is november, with of rain on average. beyond their work as a production duo, coldcut are the founders of ninja tune, an independent record label in london, england (with a satellite office in los angeles &amp; berlin) with an overall emphasis on encouraging interactive technology and finding innovative uses of software. the label\\'s first releases (the first four volumes of dj food - \"jazz brakes\") were produced by coldcut in the early 90s, and composed of instrumental hip-hop cuts that led the duo to help pioneer the trip hop genre, with artists such as funki porcini, the herbaliser and dj vadim. the catalan capital, despite the current moment of crisis, is also one of the european bases of \"reference for start-ups\" and the fifth city in the world to establish one of these companies, behind london, berlin, paris and amsterdam, according to the eu-starts-up 2020 study. other projects listed by the bbc include clito clito, body-positive jewellery made in berlin; \"clitorissima\", a documentary intended to normalize mother-daughter conversations about the clitoris; and a clitart festival in london, encompassing spoken word performances as well as visual art. french art collective les infemmes (a pun on \"infamous\" and \"women\") published a fanzine whose title can be translated as \"the clit cheatsheet\". after victoria\\'s marriage to her german cousin prince albert, by 1841 the custom became even more widespread as wealthier middle-class families followed the fashion. in 1842 a newspaper advert for christmas trees makes clear their smart cachet, german origins and association with children and gift-giving. an illustrated book, \"the christmas tree\", describing their use and origins in detail, was on sale in december 1844. on 2january 1846 elizabeth fielding (née fox strangways) wrote from lacock abbey to william henry fox-talbot: \"constance is extremely busy preparing the bohemian xmas tree. it is made from caroline\\'s description of those she saw in germany\". in 1847 prince albert wrote: \"i must now seek in the children an echo of what ernest [his brother] and i were in the old time, of what we felt and thought; and their delight in the christmas trees is not less than ours used to be\". a boost to the trend was given in 1848 when \"the illustrated london news\", in a report picked up by other papers, described the trees in windsor castle in detail and showed the main tree, surrounded by the royal family, on its cover. in fewer than ten years their use in better-off homes was widespread. by 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert alluding casually to them, as well as reporting the accidental death of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a christmas tree. they had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a report from berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where \"every family has its own\" with that of britain, where christmas trees were still the preserve of the wealthy or the \"romantic\". in may 2009, the band embarked on a concert tour in support of the album – called tour of the universe; it had been announced at a press conference in october 2008 at the olympiastadion in berlin. there was a warm up show in luxembourg and it officially started on 10 may 2009 in tel aviv. the first leg of the tour was disrupted when dave gahan was struck down with gastroenteritis. during treatment, doctors found and removed a low grade tumour from the singer\\'s bladder. gahan\\'s illness caused 16 concerts to be cancelled, but several of the shows were rescheduled for 2010. the band headlined the lollapalooza festival during the north american leg of the tour. the tour also took the band back to south america for the first time since 1994\\'s exotic tour. during the final european leg, the band played a show at london\\'s royal albert hall in aid of the teenage cancer trust, where former member alan wilder joined martin gore on stage for a performance of \"somebody\". in total the band played to more than 2.7 million people across 32 countries and the tour was one of the most profitable in america in 2009. the concerts held at palau sant jordi, barcelona, spain were filmed and later released on dvd and blu-ray disc release entitled \"\". in march 2010, depeche mode won the award for \"best international group – rock / pop\" at the echo awards in germany. \"scary monsters (and super creeps)\" (1980) produced the number-one hit \"ashes to ashes\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist chuck hammer and revisiting the character of major tom from \"space oddity\". the song gave international exposure to the underground new romantic movement when bowie visited the london club \"blitz\"—the main new romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including steve strange of the band visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. while \"scary monsters\" used principles established by the berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. the album\\'s hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from robert fripp, chuck hammer, and pete townshend. as \"ashes to ashes\" hit number one on the uk charts, bowie opened a five-month run on broadway on 29 july, starring as john merrick in \"the elephant man\". following bowie\\'s death, fans gathered at impromptu street shrines. at the mural of bowie in his birthplace of brixton, south london, which shows him in his \"aladdin sane\" character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. other memorial sites included berlin, los angeles, and outside his apartment in new york. after news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. bowie had insisted that he did not want a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in new jersey on 12 january. as he wished in his will, his ashes were scattered in a buddhist ceremony in bali, indonesia. when considering the commuter belts or metropolitan areas, within the eu (for which comparable data is available) moscow covers the largest population, followed in order by istanbul, london, paris, madrid, milan, ruhr area, saint petersburg, rhein-süd, barcelona and berlin. the \"fire, sudden noise and smoke\" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. for example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the millennium around the world. as the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the new year as the time zones changed over to the next century. fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world\\'s most famous buildings, including the sydney harbour bridge, the pyramids of giza in egypt, the acropolis in athens, red square in moscow, vatican city in rome, the brandenburg gate in berlin, the eiffel tower in paris, and elizabeth tower in london. with the london protocol of 1944 signed on 12 september 1944, the united states, the united kingdom, and the soviet union decided to divide germany into three occupation zones and to establish a special area of berlin, which was occupied by the three allied forces together. in may 1945, the soviet union installed a city government for the whole city that was called \"magistrate of greater berlin\", which existed until 1947. after the war, the allied forces initially administered the city together within the allied kommandatura, which served as the governing body of the city. however, in 1948 the soviet representative left the kommandatura and the common administration broke apart during the following months. in the soviet sector, a separate city government was established, which continued to call itself the \"magistrate of greater berlin\". husserl had transferred in 1916 to the university of freiburg (in freiburg im breisgau) where he continued bringing his work in philosophy to fruition, now as a full professor. edith stein served as his personal assistant during his first few years in freiburg, followed later by martin heidegger from 1920 to 1923. the mathematician hermann weyl began corresponding with him in 1918. husserl gave four lectures on phenomenological method at university college, london in 1922. the university of berlin in 1923 called on him to relocate there, but he declined the offer. in 1926 heidegger dedicated his book \"sein und zeit\" (\"being and time\") to him \"in grateful respect and friendship.\" husserl remained in his professorship at freiburg until he requested retirement, teaching his last class on 25 july 1928. a \"festschrift\" to celebrate his seventieth birthday was presented to him on 8 april 1929. goldman found it difficult to acclimate to the german leftist community in berlin. communists despised her outspokenness about soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. while berkman remained in berlin helping russian exiles, goldman moved to london in september 1924. upon her arrival, the novelist rebecca west arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher bertrand russell, novelist h. g. wells, and more than 200 other guests. when she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the soviet government, the audience was shocked. some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the communist experiment. later, in a letter, russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the soviet union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism. like many other early information technologies, edi was inspired by developments in military logistics. the complexity of the 1948 berlin airlift required the development of concepts and methods to exchange, sometimes over a 300 baud teletype modem, vast quantities of data and information about transported goods. these initial concepts later shaped the first tdcc (transportation data coordinating committee) standards in the us. among the first integrated systems using edi were freight control systems. one such real-time system was the london airport cargo edp scheme (laces) at heathrow airport, london, uk, in 1971. implementing the direct trader input (dti) method, it allowed forwarding agents to enter information directly into the customs processing system, reducing the time for clearance. the increase of maritime traffic and problems at customs similar to those experienced at heathrow airport led to the implementation of dti systems in individual ports or groups of ports in the 1980s. in spring 1865, kocher followed his teacher biermer to zürich, where theodor billroth was director of the hospital and influenced kocher significantly. kocher then proceeded to start a journey through europe to meet several of the most famous surgeons of the time. it is not clear how kocher financed his trip but according to bonjour (1981) he received money from an unknown female suisse romande philanthropist who also supported his friend marc dufour and was probably a member of the moravian church. in october 1865, he traveled to berlin, passing through leipzig and visiting an old friend from high school, hans blum. in berlin, he studied under bernhard von langenbeck and applied for an assistant position with langenbeck and rudolf virchow. since there was no position available, in april 1867 kocher moved on to london where he first met jonathan hutchinson and then worked for henry thompson and john erichsen. furthermore, he was interested in the work of isaac baker brown and thomas spencer wells, who also invited kocher to go to the opera with his family. in july 1867, he traveled on to paris to meet auguste nélaton, auguste verneuil and louis pasteur. during his travels, he did not only learn novel techniques but also got to know leading surgeons in person and learned to speak english fluently which allowed him later on to follow the scientific progress in the english speaking world with ease. however it was usually through domestically funded features throughout the decade that british directors and films won awards at the top international film festivals. in 2003, michael winterbottom won the golden bear at the berlin film festival for \"in this world\". in 2004, mike leigh directed \"vera drake\", an account of a housewife who leads a double life as an abortionist in 1950s london. the film won the golden lion at the venice film festival. in 2006 stephen frears directed \"the queen\" based on the events surrounding the death of princess diana, which won the best actress prize at the venice film festival and academy awards and the bafta for best film. in 2006, ken loach won the palme d\\'or at the cannes film festival with his account of the struggle for irish independence in \"the wind that shakes the barley\". joe wright\\'s adaptation of the ian mcewan novel \"atonement\" was nominated for 7 academy awards, including best film and won the golden globe and bafta for best film. \"slumdog millionaire\" was filmed entirely in mumbai with a mostly indian cast, though with a british director (danny boyle), producer (christian colson), screenwriter (simon beaufoy) and star (dev patel)—the film was all-british financed via film4 and celador. it has received worldwide critical acclaim. it has won four golden globes, seven bafta awards and eight academy awards, including best director and best film. \"the king\\'s speech\", which tells the story of king george vi\\'s attempts to overcome his speech impediment, was directed by tom hooper and filmed almost entirely in london. it received four academy awards (including best film, best director, best actor and best screenplay) in 2011. the funeral, held at the church of the madeleine in paris, was delayed almost two weeks until 30 october. entrance was restricted to ticket holders, as many people were expected to attend. over 3,000 people arrived without invitations, from as far as london, berlin and vienna, and were excluded. frankfurt central station (\"frankfurt hauptbahnhof\", often abbreviated as \"frankfurt (main) hbf\" or \"f-hbf\") is the largest railway station in germany by railway traffic. by daily passenger volume, it ranks second together with munich central station (350,000 each) after hamburg central station (450,000). it is located between the gallus, the gutleutviertel and the bahnhofsviertel district, not far away from the trade fair and the financial district. it serves as a major hub for long-distance trains (intercity, ice) and regional trains as well as for frankfurt\\'s public transport system. it is a stop for most of ice high-speed lines, making it germany\\'s most important ice station. ice trains to london via the channel tunnel were planned for 2013. all rhine-main s-bahn lines, two u-bahn lines (u4, u5), several tram and bus lines stop there. regional and local trains are integrated in the public transport system rhein-main-verkehrsverbund (rmv), the second-largest integrated public transport systems in the world, after verkehrsverbund berlin-brandenburg. dostoevsky travelled to western europe for the first time on 7 june 1862, visiting cologne, berlin, dresden, wiesbaden, belgium, and paris. in london, he met herzen and visited the crystal palace. he travelled with nikolay strakhov through switzerland and several north italian cities, including turin, livorno, and florence. he recorded his impressions of those trips in \"winter notes on summer impressions\", in which he criticised capitalism, social modernisation, materialism, catholicism and protestantism. after a brief sojourn in germany, bopp travelled to london where he made the acquaintance of sir charles wilkins and henry thomas colebrooke. he also became friends with wilhelm von humboldt, the prussian ambassador at the court of st. james\\'s, to whom he taught sanskrit. he brought out, in the \"annals of oriental literature\" (london, 1820), an essay entitled \"analytical comparison of the sanskrit, greek, latin and teutonic languages\" in which he extended to all parts of grammar what he had done in his first book for the verb alone. he had previously published a critical edition, with a latin translation and notes, of the story of nala and damayanti (london, 1819), the most beautiful episode of the \"mahabharata\". other episodes of the \"mahabharata\", \"indralokâgama\", and three others (berlin, 1824); \"diluvium\", and three others (berlin, 1829); a new edition of nala (berlin, 1832) followed in due course, all of which, with august wilhelm von schlegel\\'s edition of the \"bhagavad gita\" (1823), proved excellent aids in initiating the early student into the reading of sanskrit texts. on the publication, in calcutta, of the whole \"mahabharata\", bopp discontinued editing sanskrit texts and confined himself thenceforth exclusively to grammatical investigations. in february and march nansen published a series of newspaper articles which placed him firmly in the separatist camp. the new prime minister wanted nansen in the cabinet, but nansen had no political ambitions. however, at michelsen\\'s request he went to berlin and then to london where, in a letter to \"the times\", he presented norway\\'s legal case for a separate consular service to the english-speaking world. on 17 may 1905, norway\\'s constitution day, nansen addressed a large crowd in christiania, saying: \"now have all ways of retreat been closed. now remains only one path, the way forward, perhaps through difficulties and hardships, but forward for our country, to a free norway\". he also wrote a book, \"norway and the union with sweden\", to promote norway\\'s case abroad. graffiti in the middle east has emerged slowly, with taggers operating in egypt, lebanon, the gulf countries like bahrein or the united arab emirates, israel, and in iran. the major iranian newspaper \"hamshahri\" has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of iranian artist a1one\\'s works on tehran walls. tokyo-based design magazine, \"pingmag\", has interviewed a1one and featured photographs of his work. the israeli west bank barrier has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the berlin wall. many graffitists in israel come from other places around the globe, such as juif from los angeles and devione from london. the religious reference \"נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן\" (\"na nach nachma nachman meuman\") is commonly seen in graffiti around israel. wilhelm ii, under pressure from his new advisors after bismarck left, committed a fatal error when he decided to allow the \"reinsurance treaty\" that bismarck had negotiated with tsarist russia to lapse. it allowed russia to make a new alliance with france. germany was left with no firm ally but austria-hungary, and her support for action in annexing bosnia and herzegovina in 1908 further soured relations with russia. berlin missed the opportunity to secure an alliance with britain in the 1890s when it was involved in colonial rivalries with france, and he alienated british statesmen further by openly supporting the boers in the south african war and building a navy to rival britain\\'s. by 1911 wilhelm had completely picked apart the careful power balance established by bismarck and britain turned to france in the entente cordiale. germany\\'s only other ally besides austria was the kingdom of italy, but it remained an ally only \"pro forma\". when war came, italy saw more benefit in an alliance with britain, france, and russia, which, in the secret treaty of london in 1915 promised it the frontier districts of austria and also colonial concessions. germany did acquire a second ally in 1914 when the ottoman empire entered the war on its side, but in the long run, supporting the ottoman war effort only drained away german resources from the main fronts. \"androcles and the lion\" (1912), a less heretical study of true and false religious attitudes than \"blanco posnet\", ran for eight weeks in september and october 1913. it was followed by one of shaw\\'s most successful plays, \"pygmalion\", written in 1912 and staged in vienna the following year, and in berlin shortly afterwards. shaw commented, \"it is the custom of the english press when a play of mine is produced, to inform the world that it is not a play—that it is dull, blasphemous, unpopular, and financially unsuccessful.\\xa0... hence arose an urgent demand on the part of the managers of vienna and berlin that i should have my plays performed by them first.\" the british production opened in april 1914, starring sir herbert tree and mrs patrick campbell as, respectively, a professor of phonetics and a cockney flower-girl. there had earlier been a romantic liaison between shaw and campbell that caused charlotte shaw considerable concern, but by the time of the london premiere it had ended. the play attracted capacity audiences until july, when tree insisted on going on holiday, and the production closed. his co-star then toured with the piece in the us. in 2015, the assembly of the hungarian olympic committee and the assembly of budapest decided to bid for the 2024 summer olympics but eventually awarded to paris. budapest has also lost several bids to host the games, in 1916, 1920, 1936, 1944, and 1960 to berlin, antwerp, london, and rome, respectively. effigies, memorials and monuments of former heads of state can be designed to represent the history or aspirations of a state or its people, such as the equestrian bronze sculpture of kaiser wilhelm i, first emperor of a unified germany erected in berlin at the end of the nineteenth century; or the victoria memorial erected in front of buckingham palace london, commemorating queen victoria and her reign (1837–1901), and unveiled in 1911 by her grandson, king george v; or the monument, placed in front of the victoria memorial hall, kolkata (calcutta) (1921), commemorating queen victoria\\'s reign as empress of india from 1876. another, twentieth century, example is the mount rushmore national memorial, a group sculpture constructed (1927–1941) on a conspicuous skyline in the black hills of south dakota (40th state of the union, 1889), in the midwestern united states, representing the territorial expansion of the united states in the first 130 years from its founding, which is promoted as the \"shrine of democracy\". after acquiring his phd, ebbinghaus moved around england and france, tutoring students to support himself. in england, he may have taught in two small schools in the south of the country (gorfein, 1885). in london, in a used bookstore, he came across gustav fechner\\'s book \"elemente der psychophysik\" (\"elements of psychophysics\"), which spurred him to conduct his famous memory experiments. after beginning his studies at the university of berlin, he founded the third psychological testing lab in germany (third to wilhelm wundt and georg elias müller). he began his memory studies here in 1879. in 1885 — the same year that he published his monumental work, \"über das gedächtnis. untersuchungen zur experimentellen psychologie\", later published in english under the title \"memory: a contribution to experimental psychology\" — he was made a professor at the university of berlin, most likely in recognition of this publication. in 1890, along with arthur könig, he founded the psychological journal \"zeitschrift für physiologie und psychologie der sinnesorgane\" (\"the psychology and physiology of the sense organs\\'\"). koch gave much of his research attention on tuberculosis throughout his career. after medical expeditions to various parts of the world, he again focussed on tuberculosis from the mid-1880s. by that time the imperial health office was carrying out a project for disinfection of sputum of tuberculosis patients. koch experimented with arsenic and creosote as possible disinfectants. these chemicals and other available drugs did not work. his report in 1883 also mentioned a failed experiment on an attempt to make tuberculosis vaccine. by 1888, koch turned his attention to synthetic dyes as antibacterial chemicals. he developed a method for examining antibacterial activity by mixing the gelatin-based culture media with a yellow dye, auramin. his notebook indicates that by february 1890, he tested hundreds of compounds. in one of such tests, he found that an extract from the tuberculosis bacterium culture dissolved in glycerine could cure tuberculosis in guinea pigs. based on a series of experiments from april to july 1891, he could conclude that the extract did not kill the tuberculosis bacterium, but destroyed (by necrosis) the infected tissues, thereby depriving bacterial growth. he made a vague announcement in august 1890 at the tenth international medical congress in berlin, saying,in a communication which i made a few months ago to the international medical congress [in london in 1881], i described a substance of which the result is to make laboratory animals insensitive to inoculation of tubercle bacilli, and in the case of already infected animals, to bring the tuberculous process to a halt. other branches of physics also received attention during the period of the scientific revolution. william gilbert, court physician to queen elizabeth i, published an important work on magnetism in 1600, describing how the earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. robert boyle (1627–91) studied the behavior of gases enclosed in a chamber and formulated the gas law named for him; he also contributed to physiology and to the founding of modern chemistry. another important factor in the scientific revolution was the rise of learned societies and academies in various countries. the earliest of these were in italy and germany and were short-lived. more influential were the royal society of england (1660) and the academy of sciences in france (1666). the former was a private institution in london and included such scientists as john wallis, william brouncker, thomas sydenham, john mayow, and christopher wren (who contributed not only to architecture but also to astronomy and anatomy); the latter, in paris, was a government institution and included as a foreign member the dutchman huygens. in the 18th century, important royal academies were established at berlin (1700) and at st. petersburg (1724). the societies and academies provided the principal opportunities for the publication and discussion of scientific results during and after the scientific revolution. in 1690, james bernoulli showed that the cycloid is the solution to the tautochrone problem; and the following year, in 1691, johann bernoulli showed that a chain freely suspended from two points will form a catenary, the curve with the lowest possible center of gravity available to any chain hung between two fixed points. he then showed, in 1696, that the cycloid is the solution to the brachistochrone problem. the railway line opened for service in 1893 and was electrified in 1935. international trains ran from berlin and moscow to connect these with london via the ferry service. from 1928 to 1939 and from 1962 to 1979, hook of holland was the northern terminus of the rheingold express to frankfurt and geneva. services on the line to rotterdam centraal station were operated by ns every half-hour during the day until april 2017, when the line was closed for conversion to metro standards. it was reopened in september 2019, as an extension of the rotterdam metro. the metro line service from hook of holland does not offer direct connections to rotterdam centraal. in 1939, before the outbreak of the war, lot polish airlines, which was established in 1929, had its hub at warsaw okęcie airport. at that time, lot maintained several services, both domestic and international. warsaw had regular domestic connections with gdynia-rumia, danzig-langfuhr, katowice-muchowiec, kraków-rakowice-czyżyny, lwów-skniłów, poznań-ławica, and wilno-porubanek. furthermore, in cooperation with air france, lares, lufthansa, and malert, international connections were maintained with athens, beirut, berlin, bucharest, budapest, helsinki, kaunas, london, paris, prague, riga, rome, tallinn, and zagreb. a number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the ritz hotel in london, through its association with irving berlin\\'s song, \\'puttin\\' on the ritz\\'. the algonquin hotel in new york city is famed as the meeting place of the literary group, the algonquin round table, and hotel chelsea, also in new york city, has been the subject of a number of songs and the scene of the stabbing of nancy spungen (allegedly by her boyfriend sid vicious). the forerunner to icao was the international commission for air navigation (ican). it held its first convention in 1903 in berlin, germany, but no agreements were reached among the eight countries that attended. at the second convention in 1906, also held in berlin, twenty-seven countries attended. the third convention, held in london in 1912 allocated the first radio callsigns for use by aircraft. ican continued to operate until 1945. as germany\\'s military and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 august 1943 \"reichsführer-ss\" heinrich himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing wilhelm frick. intensive air raids on berlin and other cities took the lives of thousands of people. göring\\'s luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on london in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. while goebbels\\' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the v-1 flying bombs, launched on british targets beginning in mid-june 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. to boost morale, goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. meanwhile, in the normandy landings of 6 june 1944, the allies successfully gained a foothold in france. freedom of the press was formally established in great britain in 1695, with alan rusbridger, former editor of \"the guardian\", stating: \"licensing of the press in britain was abolished in 1695. remember how the freedoms won here became a model for much of the rest of the world, and be conscious how the world still watches us to see how we protect those freedoms.\" the first successful english daily, the \"daily courant\", was published from 1702 to 1735. while journalistic enterprises were started as private ventures in some regions, such as the holy roman empire and the british empire, other countries such as france and prussia kept tighter control of the press, treating it primarily as an outlet for government propaganda and subjecting it to uniform censorship. other governments, such as the russian empire, were even more distrusting of the journalistic press and effectively banned journalistic publications until the mid-19th century. as newspaper publication became a more and more established practice, publishers would increase publication to a weekly or daily rate. newspapers were more heavily concentrated in cities that were centres of trade, such as amsterdam, london, and berlin. the first newspapers in latin america would be established in the mid-to-late 19th century. while at berlin, he made several visits to the netherlands, in 1684, 1686, and 1688, chiefly for the purpose of superintending the printing of several of his works, including the \"traité de la vérité\", 1684. the book went through a vast number of editions and was translated into several languages, an english version, by henry lussan, appearing in 1694. completed by a third volume, the \"traité de la divinité de nôtre seigneur jésus-christ\", it appeared at rotterdam, 1689. an english translation, entitled \"a sovereign antidote against arian poyson\", appeared in london, 1719, and again \"revised, corrected, and, in a few places, abridged\", by abraham booth, under the title of \"the deity of jesus christ essential to the christian religion\", 1777. the entire apology for christianity formed by the three volumes of the \"traité\", which combated severally the heresies of atheism, deism, and socinianism, was received with praise. \"la vérité de la religion chrétienne réformée\" (1717) was a controversial treatise which in its four parts attacks the characteristic doctrines of the roman catholic church; it was translated into english, for the use of the roman catholics of his diocese of dromore, by dr. ralph lambert, afterwards bishop of meath. the work was completed in 1723 in \"le triomphe de la providence et de la religion; ou, l\\'ouverture des sept seaux par le fils de dieu, où l\\'on trouvera la première partie de l\\'apocalypse clairement expliquée par ce qu\\'il y a de plus connu dans l\\'histoire et de moins contesté dans la parole de dieu. avec une nouvelle et très-sensible démonstration de la vérité de la religion chrétienne\". on 17 april 1934, french foreign minister louis barthou issued the so-called \"barthou note\", which led to concerns on the part of hitler that the french would ask for sanctions against germany for violating part v of the versailles treaty. ribbentrop volunteered to stop the rumoured sanctions and visited london and rome. during his visits, ribbentrop met with british foreign secretary sir john simon and italian dictator benito mussolini and asked them to postpone the next meeting of the bureau of disarmament in exchange for which ribbentrop offered nothing in return other than promising better relations with berlin. the meeting of the bureau of disarmament went ahead as scheduled, but because no sanctions were sought against germany, ribbentrop could claim a success. at his wife\\'s suggestion, ribbentrop hired the berlin interior decorator martin luther to assist with his move to london and help realise the design of the new german embassy that ribbentrop had built there (he felt that the existing embassy was insufficiently grand). luther proved to be a master intriguer and became ribbentrop\\'s favourite hatchet man. ribbentrop did not understand the limited role in government exercised by 20th-century british monarchs. he thought that king edward viii, emperor of india, could dictate british foreign policy if he wanted. he convinced hitler that he had edward\\'s support, but that was as much a delusion as his belief that he had impressed british society. in fact, ribbentrop often displayed a fundamental misunderstanding of british politics and society. during the abdication crisis in december 1936, ribbentrop reported to berlin that it had been precipitated by an anti-german jewish-masonic-reactionary conspiracy to depose edward, whom ribbentrop represented as a staunch friend of germany, and that civil war would soon break out in britain between supporters of edward and those of prime minister stanley baldwin. ribbentrop\\'s civil war predictions were greeted with incredulity by the british people who heard them. duke carl alexander of württemberg had told the federal bureau of investigation that wallis simpson, edward\\'s lover and a suspected nazi sympathizer, had slept with ribbentrop in london in 1936; had remained in constant contact with him; and had continued to leak secrets. on 12 september 2018, jeff lynne\\'s elo began a tour throughout europe including dates in stockholm, oslo, copenhagen, hamburg, berlin, munich, mannheim, vienna, amsterdam, nottingham, glasgow, manchester, newcastle upon tyne, birmingham, leeds, london, liverpool, dublin, and belfast. popper won many awards and honours in his field, including the lippincott award of the american political science association, the sonning prize, the otto hahn peace medal of the united nations association of germany in berlin and fellowships in the royal society, british academy, london school of economics, king\\'s college london, darwin college, cambridge, austrian academy of sciences and charles university, prague. austria awarded him the grand decoration of honour in gold for services to the republic of austria in 1986, and the federal republic of germany its grand cross with star and sash of the order of merit, and the peace class of the order pour le mérite. he received the humanist laureate award from the international academy of humanism. he was knighted by queen elizabeth ii in 1965, and was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1976. he was invested with the insignia of a companion of honour in 1982. on 27 november 1958 another berlin crisis broke out when khrushchev submitted an ultimatum with a six-month expiry date to washington, london and paris, where he demanded that the allies pull all their forces out of west berlin and agree that west berlin become a \"free city\", or else he would sign a separate peace treaty with east germany. adenauer was opposed to any sort of negotiations with the soviets, arguing if only the west were to hang tough long enough, khrushchev would back down. as the 27 may deadline approached, the crisis was defused by the british prime minister harold macmillan, who visited moscow to meet with khrushchev and managed to extend the deadline while not committing himself or the other western powers to concessions. adenauer believed macmillan to be a spineless \"appeaser\", who had made a secret deal with khrushchev at the expense of the federal republic. born in trier, germany, marx studied law and philosophy at the universities of bonn and berlin. he married german theatre critic and political activist jenny von westphalen in 1843. due to his political publications, marx became stateless and lived in exile with his wife and children in london for decades, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with german thinker friedrich engels and publish his writings, researching in the british museum reading room. philby continued to live in the united kingdom with his wife for several years. at this point, however, philby and friedmann separated. they remained friends for many years following their separation and divorced only in 1946, just following the end of world war ii. when the germans threatened to overrun paris in 1940, where she was then living at this time, philby arranged for friedmann\\'s escape to britain. in 1936 he began working at a failing trade magazine, the \"anglo-russian trade gazette\", as editor. after the magazine\\'s owner changed the paper\\'s role to covering anglo-german trade, philby engaged in a concerted effort to make contact with germans such as joachim von ribbentrop, at that time the german ambassador in london. he became a member of the anglo-german fellowship, an organization aiming at rebuilding and supporting a friendly relationship between germany and the united kingdom. the anglo-german fellowship, at this time, was supported both by the british and german governments, and philby made many trips to berlin. he was an honorary member of the following academies and music companies: royal academy of music (london), accademia nazionale di santa cecilia (rome), royal swedish academy of music (stockholm), academy of arts (london), academia nacional de bellas artes (buenos aires), the society of friends of music in vienna, academy of arts in berlin, académie internationale de philosophie et de l’art in bern, and the académie nationale des sciences, belles-lettres et arts in bordeaux. in 2009, he became an honorary citizen of the city of bydgoszcz. in 1932, paxinou was among the actors who inaugurated the recently re-founded national theatre of greece, where she worked until 1940. during her stay in the national theatre, she distinguished herself on greek stage starring in major plays, such as sophocles\\' \"electra\", henrik ibsen\\'s \"ghosts\" and william shakespeare\\'s \"hamlet\", which were also performed in london, frankfurt and berlin. in 1851, london zoo became the first zoo to keep kiwi. the first captive breeding took place in 1945. as of 2007 only 13 zoos outside new zealand hold kiwi. the frankfurt zoo has 12, the berlin zoo has seven, walsrode bird park has one, the avifauna bird park in the netherlands has three, the san diego zoo has five, the san diego zoo safari park has one, the national zoo in washington, dc has eleven, the smithsonian conservation biology institute has one, and the columbus zoo and aquarium has three. relations with the west were strained by a series of incidents for most of gaddafi\\'s rule, including the killing of london policewoman yvonne fletcher, the bombing of a west berlin nightclub frequented by u.s. servicemen, and the bombing of pan am flight 103, which led to un sanctions in the 1990s, though by the late 2000s, the united states and other western powers had normalised relations with libya. latvia purchased embassy buildings in berlin (1922), tallinn, warsaw (1923), london (1925), paris (1927), geneva (1938). london\\'s gross regional product in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of uk gdp. london has five major business districts: the city, westminster, canary wharf, camden &amp; islington and lambeth &amp; southwark. one way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: greater london had 27\\xa0million m2 of office space in 2001, and the city contains the most space, with 8\\xa0million m2 of office space. london has some of the highest real estate prices in the world. london is the world\\'s most expensive office market according to world property journal (2015) report. the residential property in london is worth $2.2 trillion – the same value as that of brazil\\'s annual gdp. the city has the highest property prices of any european city according to the office for national statistics and the european office of statistics. on average the price per square metre in central london is €24,252 (april 2014). this is higher than the property prices in other g8 european capital cities; berlin €3,306, rome €6,188 and paris €11,229. liverpool has also featured in films; see [[list of films set in liverpool]] for some of them. in films the city has \"doubled\" for london, paris, new york, chicago, moscow, dublin, venice and berlin. lennon walls have also appeared outside of hong kong in the cities of: toronto, vancouver bc, calgary, seoul, tokyo, berlin, london, sydney, manchester, melbourne, taipei, and auckland. it was at this moment that the united states air force, having taken over these efforts while moving from the united states army air forces, dropped their interest in the project. although the reasons are not well recorded, it appears the idea of a fully automated bombing system using radio aids was no longer considered possible. the aaf had been involved in missions covering about 1000\\xa0km (the distance from london to berlin) and the cytac system would work well at these ranges, but as the mission changed to trans-polar missions of 5,000\\xa0km or more, even cytac did not offer the range and accuracy needed. they turned their attention to the use of inertial platforms and doppler radar systems, cancelling work on cytac as well as a competing system known as navarho. there are two embassies in monaco: those of france and italy. there are about another 30 or so consulates. by the 21st century monaco maintained embassies in belgium (brussels), france (paris), germany (berlin), the vatican, italy (rome), portugal (lisbon), spain (madrid), switzerland (bern), united kingdom (london) and the united states (washington). the war was fundamental in re-arranging bloch\\'s approach to history, although he never acknowledged it as a turning point. in the years following the war, a disillusioned bloch rejected the ideas and the traditions that had formed his scholarly training. he rejected the political and biographical history which up until that point was the norm, along with what the historian george huppert has described as a \"laborious cult of facts\" that accompanied it. in 1920, with the opening of the university of strasbourg, bloch was appointed \"chargé de cours\" (assistant lecturer) of medieval history. alsace-lorraine had been returned to france with the treaty of versailles; the status of the region was a contentious political issue in strasbourg, its capital, which had a large german population. bloch, however, refused to take either side in the debate; indeed, he appears to have avoided politics entirely. under wilhelmine germany, strasbourg had rivalled berlin as a centre for intellectual advancement, and the university of strasbourg possessed the largest academic library in the world. thus, says stephan r. epstein of the london school of economics, \"bloch\\'s unrivalled knowledge of the european middle ages was ... built on and around the french university of strasbourg\\'s inherited german treasures\". bloch also taught french to the few german students who were still at the centre d\\'études germaniques at the university of mainz during the occupation of the rhineland. he refrained from taking a public position when france occupied the ruhr in 1923 over germany\\'s perceived failure to pay war reparations. many recurring course themes are based on the \"mario\" franchise, such as bowser\\'s castle. unique courses inspired by the mushroom kingdom include rainbow road, above a city or in space. each game after \"super mario kart\" includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas. each game\\'s tracks are divided into four \"cups\" (except \"mario kart: super circuit\", which has five), or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall ranking to win. they are the mushroom cup, the flower cup, the star cup, and the special cup. most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, the unlockable tracks in \"mario kart: super circuit\", seven in \"mario kart: double dash!!\" when racing on baby park, and two in \"mario kart: double dash!!\" when racing on wario colosseum, 5 laps in \"mario kart ds\" when racing on gcn baby park, 1 lap split into 3 parts in \"mario kart 7\" when racing on maka wuhu (wuhu mountain loop in pal regions), wuhu loop (wuhu island loop in pal regions), and rainbow road, 1 lap split into 3 parts in \"mario kart 8\" and \"mario kart 8 deluxe\" when racing on mount wario, n64 rainbow road, and big blue, 7 laps in \"mario kart 8\" and \"mario kart 8 deluxe\" when racing on gcn baby park, and in \"mario kart tour\", where all tracks are two laps. the first game to feature courses from previous games was \"mario kart: super circuit\", which contained all of the tracks from the original snes game. starting with \"mario kart ds\", each entry in the series has featured sixteen \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and sixteen \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous \"mario kart\" games) (not including dlc tracks and games from \"mario kart 8 deluxe\"), spread across four cups each with four races. the four retro grand prix cups are the shell cup, the banana cup, the leaf cup, and the lightning cup. in \"mario kart 8\", sixteen additional tracks are available across two downloadable packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other nintendo franchises, including \"excitebike\", \"f-zero\", \"the legend of zelda\", and \"animal crossing\" divided into four additional cups; the egg cup, the triforce cup, the crossing cup, and the bell cup. \"mario kart tour\" introduced courses themed from places around the world including new york city, tokyo, singapore, paris, london, los angeles, berlin, vancouver, amsterdam and sydney, and variant courses raced in reverse, with additional ramps and elevation, and a combination of the two. forty-eight additional courses from every game in the series are set to arrive to \"mario kart 8 deluxe\" in the booster course pass in six waves, divided into twelve additional cups: golden dash, lucky cat, turnip, propeller, rock, moon, fruit, boomerang, feather, cherry, acorn, and spiny. streets named for faraday can be found in many british cities (e.g., london, [[fife]], [[swindon]], [[basingstoke]], [[nottingham]], [[whitby]], [[kirkby]], [[crawley]], [[newbury, berkshire|newbury]], [[swansea]], [[aylesbury]] and [[stevenage]]) as well as in france (paris), germany ([[berlin]]-[[dahlem (berlin)|dahlem]], [[hermsdorf, thuringia|hermsdorf]]), canada ([[quebec city]], quebec; [[deep river, ontario|deep river]], ontario; ottawa, ontario), the united states ([[reston, virginia|reston]], virginia), and new zealand ([[hawke\\'s bay region|hawke\\'s bay]]). cassatt grew up in an environment that viewed travel as integral to education; she spent five years in europe and visited many of the capitals, including london, paris, and berlin. while abroad she learned german and french and had her first lessons in drawing and music. it is likely that her first exposure to french artists jean auguste dominique ingres, eugène delacroix, camille corot, and gustave courbet was at the paris world\\'s fair of 1855. also in the exhibition were edgar degas and camille pissarro, both of whom were later her colleagues and mentors. in may 1914 maria feodorovna travelled to england to visit her sister. while she was in london, world war i broke out (july 1914), forcing her to hurry home to russia. in berlin the german authorities prevented her train from continuing toward the russian border. instead she had to return to russia by way of (neutral) denmark and finland. upon her return in august, she took up residence at yelagin palace, which was closer to st. petersburg (renamed petrograd in august 1914) than gatchina. during the war she served as president of russia\\'s red cross. as she had done a decade earlier in the russo-japanese war of 1904–1905, she also financed a sanitary train. chamberlain returned to london in triumph. large crowds mobbed heston, where he was met by the lord chamberlain, the earl of clarendon, who gave him a letter from king george vi assuring him of the empire\\'s lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to buckingham palace to report. the streets were so packed with cheering people that it took chamberlain an hour and a half to journey the nine miles (14\\xa0km) from heston to the palace. after reporting to the king, chamberlain and his wife appeared on the palace balcony with the king and queen. he then went to downing street; both the street and the front hall of number 10 were packed. as he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, \"neville, go up to the window and say \\'peace for our time\\'.\" chamberlain turned around and responded, \"no, i don\\'t do that sort of thing.\" nevertheless, in his statement to the crowd, chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor, benjamin disraeli, upon the latter\\'s return from the congress of berlin: in 1754, he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences. he was also an honorary member of the academies of saint petersburg and berlin, the royal society of london and the royal society of göttingen, and the institute of bologna. another popular ninja tune artist, travis stewart, a.k.a. nyc/berlin artist machinedrum signed up with the label in 2013, first releasing \"eyesdontlie\" that july, a single which xlr8r donned \"quite possibly deeper and more ambitious than anything we\\'ve heard from stewart to date\". after releasing a second 12\" (\"gunshotta ave\") the following month, machinedrum released his full lp \"vapor city\" at the end of september 2013. a visceral album about an imaginary metropolis, \"vapor city\" received much acclaim from critics and djs alike, even landing three live performances on the boiler room (new york, berlin and london). machinedrum claimed it was his biggest and boldest project to date. the negotiators decided that the tribunal\\'s permanent seat would be located in berlin, while the trial would be held at the palace of justice in nuremberg. located in the american occupation zone, nuremberg was a symbolic location as the site of nazi rallies. the palace of justice was relatively intact but needed to be renovated for the trial due to bomb damage; it had an attached prison where the defendants could be held. on 8 august, the nuremberg charter was signed in london. nineteen countries ratified the charter and were admitted as observers.

berlin, madrid and rome. eurostat places paris (6.5 million people) behind london (8 million) and ahead of berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\". in august\\xa01963, disturbed about his treatment, friends and family had robeson transferred to the buch clinic in east berlin. given psychotherapy and less medication, his physicians found him still \"completely without initiative\" and they expressed \"doubt and anger\" about the \"high level of barbiturates and ect\" that had been administered in london. he rapidly improved, though his doctor stressed that \"what little is left of paul\\'s health must be quietly conserved.\" in 1961, cook opened the establishment, a club at 18 greek street in soho in central london, presenting fellow comedians in a nightclub setting, including american lenny bruce. cook said it was a satirical venue modelled on \"those wonderful berlin cabarets ... which did so much to stop the rise of hitler and prevent the outbreak of the second world war\"; as a members-only venue, it was outside the censorship restrictions. the establishment\\'s regular cabaret performers were eleanor bron, john bird, and john fortune. by the second half of the 19th century, berlin had been growing at a tremendous rate for some time, but its growth accelerated even faster after the city became the capital of the new german empire on 18 january 1871. potsdamer platz and neighbouring leipziger platz came into their own afterward. now firmly in the centre of a metropolis whose population eventually reached 4.4\\xa0million, making it the third largest city in the world after london and new york, the area was ready to take on its most celebrated role. vast hotels and department stores, hundreds of smaller shops, theatres, dance-halls, cafés, restaurants, bars, beer palaces, wine-houses and clubs, all started to appear. some of these places became internationally known. the heyday of potsdamer platz was in the 1920s and 1930s. by this time it had developed into the busiest traffic center in all of europe, and the heart of berlin\\'s nightlife. it had acquired an iconic status, on a par with piccadilly circus in london or times square in new york. it was a key location that helped to symbolize berlin; it was known worldwide, and a legend grew up around it. it represented the geographical center of the city, the meeting place of five of its busiest streets in a star-shaped intersection deemed the transport hub of the entire continent. these were: at the potsdamer platz up to 11 policemen at a time had tried to control all this traffic but with varying success. the delays in tram traffic increased and the job was very dangerous for the policemen. the \"berliner straßenbahn-betriebs-gmbh\" started researches to control the traffic on the main streets and places in 1924. berlin traffic experts visits colleagues paris, london and new york. they had to organize the traffic, define traffic rules and select a solution to control the traffic. in new york, fifth avenue they found traffic light towers designed by joseph h. freedlander in 1922 which can be regarded as a model for the berlin tower. the quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. the last population in the wild, in the orange free state, was extirpated in the late 1870s. the last known wild quagga died in 1878. the specimen in london died in 1872 and the one in berlin in 1875. the last captive quagga, a female in amsterdam\\'s natura artis magistra zoo, lived there from 9\\xa0may 1867 until it died on 12\\xa0august 1883, but its origin and cause of death are unclear. its death was not recognised as signifying the extinction of its kind at the time, and the zoo requested another specimen; hunters believed it could still be found \"closer to the interior\" in the cape colony. since locals used the term quagga to refer to all zebras, this may have led to the confusion. the extinction of the quagga was internationally accepted by the 1900 convention for the preservation of wild animals, birds and fish in africa. the last specimen was featured on a dutch stamp in 1988. the specimen itself was mounted and is kept in the collection of naturalis biodiversity center in leiden. it has been on display for special occasions. in 2004, the arrival of low-cost airlines resulted in cheaper flights from other european cities such as london and berlin, and consequently a substantial increase in numbers of tourists. in the spring of 2006, the hitherto biggest party of hospitality exchange service hc took place in riga, counting 430 participants from 36 countries. rammstein began to record their first studio album, \"herzeleid\", in march 1995 with producer jacob hellner. they released their first single \"du riechst so gut\" that august and released the album in september. later that year, they toured with clawfinger in warsaw and prague. rammstein headlined a 17-show tour of germany in december, which helped boost the band\\'s popularity and establish them as a credible live act. they went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single titled \"seemann\" on 8 january. on 27 march 1996, rammstein performed on mtv\\'s \"hanging out\" in london, their first performance in the uk. their first major boost in popularity outside germany came when nine inch nails frontman trent reznor chose two rammstein songs, \"heirate mich\" and \"rammstein\", during his work as music director for the david lynch 1997 film \"lost highway\". the soundtrack for the film was released in the u.s. in late 1996 and later throughout europe in april 1997. in the middle of 1996, they headlined one tour of their own in small, sold-out venues. rammstein went on to tour through germany, austria, and switzerland from september to october 1996, performing an anniversary concert on 27 september called \"100 years of rammstein\". guests to the concert included moby, bobo, and the berlin session orchestra, while berlin director gert hof was responsible for the light show. gordon continued her stage-acting career in the 1950s, and was nominated for a 1956 tony, for best performance by a leading actress in a play, for her portrayal of dolly levi in thornton wilder\\'s \"the matchmaker\", a role she also played in london, edinburgh, and berlin. on 2 october 2009, the international olympic committee selected rio de janeiro to host the 2016 summer olympics. rio made their first bid for the 1936 summer olympics, but lost to berlin. they later made bids for the 2004 and 2012 games, but failed to become a candidate city both times. those games were awarded to athens and london respectively. in 1902, claude montefiore and several friends, including lily montagu and israel abrahams, founded the jewish religious union (jru) in london. it served as the cornerstone of liberal judaism in britain. montefiore was greatly influenced by the ideas of early german reformers. he and his associates were mainly driven by the example and challenge of unitarianism, which offered upper-class jews a universal, enlightened belief. meyer noted that while he had original strains, montefiore was largely dependent on geiger and his concepts of progressive revelation, instrumentality of ritual et cetera. his liberal judaism was radical and puristic, matching and sometimes exceeding the berlin and american variants. they sharply abridged liturgy and largely discarded practice. langton has argued for the distinctly anglo-jewish character of the movement, which was dominated by montefiore\\'s idiosyncratic ideas. on 4 february 2008, anti-farc protests were held in 45 colombian cities and towns, with an estimated 1.5\\xa0million people coming out in bogotá alone. solidarity rallies were held in some 200 cities worldwide including berlin, barcelona, london, madrid, toronto, dubai, miami, new york, brisbane, and la paz. the protests were originally organised through facebook and were also supported by local colombian media outlets as well as the colombian government. participation estimates vary from the hundreds of thousands to several millions of people in colombia and thousands worldwide. nevanlinna\\'s work was recognised in the form of honorary degrees which he held from the universities of heidelberg, the university of bucharest, the university of giessen, the free university of berlin, the university of glasgow, the university of uppsala, the university of istanbul and the university of jyväskylä. he was an honorary member of several learned societies, among them the london mathematical society and the hungarian academy of sciences. — the 1679 nevanlinna main belt asteroid is named after him. freud\\'s early followers met together formally for the first time at the hotel bristol, salzburg on 27 april 1908. this meeting, which was retrospectively deemed to be the first international psychoanalytic congress, was convened at the suggestion of ernest jones, then a london-based neurologist who had discovered freud\\'s writings and begun applying psychoanalytic methods in his clinical work. jones had met jung at a conference the previous year and they met up again in zürich to organize the congress. there were, as jones records, \"forty-two present, half of whom were or became practicing analysts.\" in addition to jones and the viennese and zürich contingents accompanying freud and jung, also present and notable for their subsequent importance in the psychoanalytic movement were karl abraham and max eitingon from berlin, sándor ferenczi from budapest and the new york-based abraham brill. in january 1933, the nazi party took control of germany, and freud\\'s books were prominent among those they burned and destroyed. freud remarked to ernest jones: \"what progress we are making. in the middle ages they would have burned me. now, they are content with burning my books.\" freud continued to underestimate the growing nazi threat and remained determined to stay in vienna, even following the anschluss of 13 march 1938, in which nazi germany annexed austria, and the outbreaks of violent antisemitism that ensued. jones, the then president of the international psychoanalytical association (ipa), flew into vienna from london via prague on 15 march determined to get freud to change his mind and seek exile in britain. this prospect and the shock of the arrest and interrogation of anna freud by the gestapo finally convinced freud it was time to leave austria. jones left for london the following week with a list provided by freud of the party of émigrés for whom immigration permits would be required. back in london, jones used his personal acquaintance with the home secretary, sir samuel hoare, to expedite the granting of permits. there were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the royal society, sir william bragg, to write to the foreign secretary lord halifax, requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in berlin and vienna on freud\\'s behalf. freud also had support from american diplomats, notably his ex-patient and american ambassador to france, william bullitt. bullitt alerted u.s. president roosevelt to the increased dangers facing the freuds, resulting in the american consul-general in vienna, john cooper wiley, arranging regular monitoring of berggasse 19. he also intervened by phone call during the gestapo interrogation of anna freud. in germany, strikes and protests against food shortage, mainly by women, escalated and by 1917 had eroded public confidence in the government. the german emperor was forced to abdicate in november 1918 after sailors\\' mutinies sparked an insurrectionary movement throughout the country. the syndicalist fvdg, which had just 6,000 members before the war and was almost completely suppressed by the state during the war, regrouped at a conference in berlin in december 1918. it was active in the revolutionary events of the following years, particularly in the ruhr area. it supported spontaneous strikes and championed direct action and sabotage. the fvdg started to be held in high regard for its radicalism by workers, particularly miners, who appreciated the syndicalists\\' ability to theorize their struggles and their experience with direct action methods. starting in the second half of 1919, workers disappointed by the socialist party\\'s and unions\\' support for the war and previously non-unionized unskilled workers who were radicalized during the war flocked to the fvdg. the revolution also saw the introduction to germany of industrial unionism along the lines of the iww with some support from the american organization, but also with links to the left wing of the communist party. in december 1919, the free workers\\' union of germany (syndicalists) (, faud) was formed, claiming to represent over 110,000 workers, more than eighteen times the fvdg\\'s pre-war membership. most of the new organization came from the fvdg, but industrial unionists, whose influence was dwindling, were also involved. rudolf rocker, an anarchist recently returned to germany after spending several years in london, wrote the faud\\'s program. the protests of 1968 represented a worldwide escalation of social conflicts, predominantly characterised by popular rebellions against military, capitalist and bureaucratic elites who responded with an escalation of political repression. these protests marked a turning point for the civil rights movement in the united states which produced revolutionary movements like the black panther party. the prominent civil rights leader martin luther king jr. organised the \"poor people\\'s campaign\" to address issues of economic justice, while personally showing sympathy with democratic socialism. in reaction to the tet offensive, protests also sparked a broad movement in opposition to the vietnam war all over the united states and even into london, paris, berlin and rome. in 1968, the international of anarchist federations was founded during a conference held in carrara by the three existing european federations of france, the italian and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile. in the late 19th century, after the berlin conference of 1884, european powers began the scramble for africa. in that year, a british protectorate was declared over part of somalia, on the african coast opposite south yemen. initially, this region was under the control of the indian office, and so administered as part of the indian empire; in 1898 it was transferred to control by london. the first post-war games were held in 1948 in london, with both germany and japan excluded. dutch sprinter fanny blankers-koen won four gold medals on the track, emulating owens\\' achievement in berlin. the icw commanded respect at the highest levels. president cleveland and his wife sponsored a reception at the white house for delegates to the icw\\'s founding congress. the icw\\'s second congress was an integral part of the world\\'s columbian exposition held in chicago in 1893. at its third congress in london in 1899, a reception for the icw was held at windsor castle at the invitation of queen victoria. at its fourth congress in berlin in 1904, augusta victoria, the german empress, received the icw leaders at her palace. anthony played a prominent role on all four occasions. at the turn of the 20th century, synchronised swimming was known as water ballet. the first recorded competition was in 1891 in berlin, germany. many swim clubs were formed around that time, and the sport simultaneously developed in canada. as well as existing as a sport, it often constituted a popular addition to music hall evenings, in the larger variety theatres of london or glasgow which were equipped with on-stage water tanks for the purpose. the discovery of sennacherib\\'s own inscriptions in the 19th\\xa0century, in which brutal and cruel acts such as ordering the throats of his elamite enemies to be slit, and their hands and lips cut off, amplified his already ferocious reputation. today, many such inscriptions are known, most of them housed in the collections of the vorderasiatisches museum in berlin and the british museum in london, though many are located throughout the world in other institutions and private collections. some large objects with sennacherib\\'s inscriptions remain at nineveh, where some have even been reburied. sennacherib\\'s own accounts of his building projects and military campaigns, typically referred to as his \"annals\", were often copied several times and spread throughout the neo-assyrian empire during his reign. for the first six years of his reign, they were written on clay cylinders, but he later began using clay prisms, probably because they provided a greater surface area. in the autumn of 1928, with \"october\" still under fire in many soviet quarters, eisenstein left the soviet union for a tour of europe, accompanied by his perennial film collaborator grigori aleksandrov and cinematographer eduard tisse. officially, the trip was supposed to allow the three to learn about sound motion pictures and to present themselves as soviet artists in person to the capitalist west. for eisenstein, however, it was an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside the soviet union. he spent the next two years touring and lecturing in berlin, zürich, london, and paris. in 1929, in switzerland, eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by tisse, entitled \"frauennot – frauenglück\". he was born in focşani, moldavia (now romania) to rabbi yitzchok hakohen, a shochet (\"ritual slaughterer\") and member of chabad hasidim. he was named after its founder, shneur zalman of liadi. schechter received his early education from his father. reportedly, he learned to read hebrew by age 3, and by 5 mastered chumash. he went to a yeshiva in piatra neamț at age 10 and at age thirteen studied with one of the major talmudic scholars, rabbi joseph saul nathanson of lemberg. in his 20s, he went to the rabbinical college in vienna, where he studied under the more modern talmudic scholar meir friedmann, before moving on in 1879 to undertake further studies at the \"berlin hochschule für die wissenschaft des judentums\" and at the university of berlin. in 1882, he was invited to britain, to be tutor of rabbinics under claude montefiore in london. christopher street liberation day, on june 28, 1970, marked the first anniversary of the stonewall riots with an assembly on christopher street; with simultaneous gay pride marches in los angeles and chicago, these were the first gay pride marches in us history. the next year, gay pride marches took place in boston, dallas, milwaukee, london, paris, west berlin and stockholm. the march in new york covered 51 blocks, from christopher street to central park. the march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers. \"the new york times\" reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks. reporting by \"the village voice\" was positive, describing \"the out-front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the stonewall inn one year ago\". when brecht died in 1956, the berliner ensemble still had not produced \"fear and misery in the third reich\"which at various times was also called \"99%\" and \"the private life of the master race\"but brecht had prepared it for publication, which came out in 1957. that same year, scenes from the work were staged by five young directors of the ensemble. one of them, peter palitzsch, directed the world premiere of \"the resistible rise of arturo ui\" in stuttgart, west germany, in 1958. the ensemble itself first produced the play four months later, with palitzsch and manfred wekwerth co-directing, and ekkehard schall as arturo ui. this production, \"staged in fairground style, with ruthless verve and brassy vulgarity\" was presented also in berlin, london and at the paris international theatre festival. a later production by the berliner ensemble, directed by heiner müller has run in repertory since june 1995, with martin wuttke in the title role. in the winter of 1927–28, elizabeth hauptmann, brecht\\'s lover at the time, received a copy of gay\\'s play from friends in england and, fascinated by the female characters and its critique of the condition of the london poor, began translating it into german. brecht at first took little interest in her translation project, but in april 1928 he attempted to interest the impresario in a play he was writing called \"fleischhacker\", which he had, in fact, already promised to another producer. aufricht was seeking a production to launch his new theatre company at the theater am schiffbauerdamm in berlin, but was not impressed by the sound of \"fleischhacker\". brecht immediately proposed a translation of \"the beggar\\'s opera\" instead, claiming that he himself had been translating it. he delivered hauptmann\\'s translation to aufricht, who immediately signed a contract for it. after the defeat of the 1848 revolutions the \"manifesto\" fell into obscurity, where it remained throughout the 1850s and 1860s. hobsbawm says that by november 1850 the \"manifesto\" \"had become sufficiently scarce for marx to think it worth reprinting section iii [...] in the last issue of his [short-lived] london magazine\". over the next two decades only a few new editions were published; these include an (unauthorised and occasionally inaccurate) 1869 russian translation by mikhail bakunin in geneva and an 1866 edition in berlin—the first time the \"manifesto\" was published in germany. according to hobsbawm: \"by the middle 1860s virtually nothing that marx had written in the past was any longer in print\". however, john cowell-stepney did publish an abridged version in the \"social economist\" in august/september 1869, in time for the basle congress. he has said the work owed much to robert bolt\\'s \"flowering cherry\" and arthur miller\\'s \"death of a salesman\". within a week after sending \"a walk on the water\" to an agent, stoppard received his version of the \"hollywood-style telegrams that change struggling young artists\\' lives.\" his first play was optioned, staged in hamburg, then broadcast on british independent television in 1963. from september 1962 until april 1963, stoppard worked in london as a drama critic for \"scene\" magazine, writing reviews and interviews both under his name and the pseudonym william boot (taken from evelyn waugh\\'s \"scoop\"). in 1964, a ford foundation grant enabled stoppard to spend 5 months writing in a berlin mansion, emerging with a one-act play titled \"rosencrantz and guildenstern meet king lear\", which later evolved into his tony-winning play \"rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead\". around the turn of the year, the band members attended a special private screening of a new film, \"rude boy\"; part fiction, part rockumentary, it tells the story of a clash fan who leaves his job in a soho sex shop to become a roadie for the group. the movie—named after the rude boy subculture—includes footage of the band on tour, at a london rock against racism concert, and in the studio recording \"give \\'em enough rope.\" the band was so disenchanted with it that they had better badges make buttons that declared \"i don\\'t want rude boy clash film\". on 27 february 1980, it premiered at the 30th berlin international film festival, where it won an honourable mention. the first permanent tram line in continental europe was opened in paris in 1855 by alphonse loubat who had previously worked on american streetcar lines. the tram was developed in numerous cities of europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in berlin, budapest, birmingham, saint petersburg, lisbon, london, manchester, paris, kyiv). historically, the paris tram system was, at its peak, the world\\'s largest system, with of track in 1925 (according to other sources, ca. of route length in 1930). however it was completely closed in 1938. the next largest system appears to have been , in buenos aires before 19 february 1963. the third largest was chicago, with over of track, but it was all converted to trolleybus and bus services by 21 june 1958. before its decline, the bvg in berlin operated a very large network with of route. before its system started to be converted to trolleybus (and later bus) services in the 1930s (last tramway closed 6 july 1952), the first-generation london network had of route in 1931. in 1958 trams in rio de jainero were employed on () of track. the final line, the santa teresa route was closed in 1968. during a period in the 1980s, the world\\'s largest tram system was in leningrad (now known as st. petersburg) with , ussr, and was included as such in the guinness world records; however saint petersburg\\'s tram system has declined in size since the fall of the soviet union. vienna in 1960 had , before the expansion of bus services and the opening of a subway (1976). substituting subway services for tram routes continues. was in minneapolis-saint paul in 1947: there streetcars ended 31 october 1953 in minneapolis and 19 june 1954 in st. paul. the sydney tram network, before it was closed on 25 february 1961, had of route, and was thus the largest in australia. as from 1961, the melbourne system (currently recognised as the world\\'s largest) took over sydney\\'s title as the largest network in australia. the british and irish modern music institute offers ba courses in modern musicianship – validated by the university – at its centres in london, berlin, hamburg, brighton, manchester, bristol and birmingham. volkswagen ag shares are also listed and traded on other major domestic and worldwide stock exchanges. in germany\\'s domestic exchanges, since 1961 these include those in berlin, düsseldorf, hamburg, hanover, munich and stuttgart. international exchanges include those in basel (listed in 1967), geneva (1967), zürich (1967), luxembourg (1979), london (1988), and new york (1988). the london protocol of 1944 and the potsdam agreement established the legal framework for the occupation of germany in the wake of world war ii. according to these agreements, germany would be formally under the administration of four allies (the united states, the united kingdom, the soviet union, and france) until a german government \"acceptable to all parties\" could be established. the territory of germany, as it existed in 1937, would be reduced by most of \"eastern germany\" thus creating the former eastern territories of germany. the remaining territory would be divided into four zones, each administered by one of the four allied countries. berlin, which was surrounded by the soviet zone of occupation—newly established in most of middle germany—would be similarly divided, with the western allies occupying an enclave consisting of the western parts of the city. according to the agreement, the occupation of berlin could end only as a result of a quadripartite agreement. the western allies were guaranteed three air corridors to their sectors of berlin, and the soviets also informally allowed road and rail access between west berlin and the western parts of germany (see section on traffic). rejmont sent his short stories to different magazines and, encouraged by good reviews, decided to write novels: \"komediantka\" (\"the deceiver\") (1895) and \"fermenty\" (\"ferments\") (1896). no longer poor, he would soon satisfy his passion for travel, visiting berlin, london, paris, and italy. then, he spent a few months in łódź collecting material for a new novel ordered by the \"kurier codzienny\" (\"the daily courier\") from warsaw. the earnings from this book \"ziemia obiecana\" (\"the promised land\") (1899) enabled him to go on his next trip to france where he socialized with other exiled poles (jan lorentowicz, żeromski, przybyszewski and lucjan rydel). the roaring twenties brought about several novel and highly visible social and cultural trends. these trends, made possible by sustained economic prosperity, were most visible in major cities like new york, chicago, paris, berlin and london. \"normalcy\" returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism during world war i, jazz blossomed, and art deco peaked. for women, knee-length skirts and dresses became socially acceptable, as did bobbed hair with a finger wave or marcel wave. the women who pioneered these trends were frequently referred to as flappers. in 2015, the assembly of the hungarian olympic committee and the assembly of budapest decided to bid for the 2024 summer olympics. budapest has lost several bids to host the games, in 1916, 1920, 1936, 1944, and 1960 to berlin, antwerp, london, and rome, respectively. the hungarian parliament also voted to support the bid on 28 january 2016, later budapest city council approved list of venues and budapest became an official candidate for the 2024 summer olympic games. however, they have recently withdrawn and only paris and los angeles remain as candidates for the 2024 olympics. a key early hire was edward r. murrow in 1935; his first corporate title was director of talks. he was mentored in microphone technique by robert trout, the lone full-time member of the news division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with his boss white. murrow was glad to \"leave the hothouse atmosphere of the new york office behind\" when he was dispatched to london as cbs\\'s european director in 1937, when the growing hitler menace underscored the need for a robust european bureau. halberstam described murrow in london as \"the right man in the right place in the right era\". murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists who would become known as the \"murrow boys\", including such men as william l. shirer, charles collingwood, bill downs, and eric sevareid. they were \"in [murrow\\'s] own image, sartorially impeccable, literate, often liberal, and prima donnas all\". they covered history in the making, and sometimes made it themselves. on march 12, 1938, hitler boldly annexed nearby austria, and murrow and the boys quickly assembled coverage with shirer in london, edgar ansel mowrer in paris, pierre huss in berlin, frank gervasi in rome, and trout in new york. this bore the now-ubiquitous \"news round-up\" format. the first performances outside the kingdom of italy were in trieste and vienna, in may 1893. the work was given in the americas and across europe. the berlin premiere of 1893 so excited ferruccio busoni that he drafted a letter to verdi, in which he addressed him as \"italy\\'s leading composer\" and \"one of the noblest persons of our time\", and in which he explained that \"\"falstaff\" provoked in me such a revolution of spirit that i can\\xa0... date [to the experience] the beginning of a new epoch in my artistic life.\" antonio scotti played the title role in buenos aires in july 1893; gustav mahler conducted the opera in hamburg in january 1894; a russian translation was presented in st petersburg in the same month. paris was regarded by many as the operatic capital of europe, and for the production there in april 1894 boito, who was fluent in french, made his own translation with the help of the parisian poet paul solanges. this translation, approved by verdi, is quite free in its rendering of boito\\'s original italian text. boito was content to delegate the english and german translations to william beatty-kingston and max kalbeck respectively. the london premiere, sung in italian, was at covent garden on 19 may 1894. the conductor was mancinelli, and zilli and pini corsi repeated their original roles. falstaff was sung by arturo pessina; maurel played the role at covent garden the following season. on 4 february 1895 the work was first presented at the metropolitan opera, new york; mancinelli conducted and the cast included maurel as falstaff, emma eames as alice, zélie de lussan as nannetta and sofia scalchi as mistress quickly. at the opéra-comique, after its 1883 revival, \"carmen\" was always presented in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments. by 1888, the year of the 50th anniversary of bizet\\'s birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. however, outside france the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the carl rosa opera company\\'s 1947 london production, and walter felsenstein\\'s 1949 staging at the berlin komische oper, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in france. neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at covent garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first american production with spoken dialogue, in colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate. subsequent operas by leoncavallo were in the 1900s: \"zazà\" (the opera of geraldine farrar\\'s famous 1922 farewell performance at the metropolitan opera), and 1904\\'s \"der roland von berlin\". in 1906 the composer brought singers and orchestral musicians from la scala to perform concerts of his music in new york, as well as an extensive tour of the united states. the tour was, all in all, a qualified success. he had a brief success with \"zingari\" which premiered in italian in london in 1912, with a long run at the hippodrome theatre. \"zingari\" also reached the united states but soon disappeared from the repertoire. cimarosa\\'s success was international. he was, together with paisiello, the most popular opera composer in the late 18th century. he composed 60 opere buffe and 20 opere serie, many of which quickly entered the repertoire of opera houses throughout europe. they were performed in berlin, copenhagen, hamburg, london, prague and stockholm, as well as st petersburg, vienna and all the main italian cities. between 1783 and 1790 haydn conducted performances of thirteen cimarosa operas for his employers at schloss esterházy and many of the pieces were given several times. cimarosa\\'s \"la ballerina amante\", a \"commedia per musica\" first performed in naples was chosen as the inaugural work at the teatro nacional de são carlos, lisbon, in june 1793. located in london, the ebrd was intended at its beginning to focus on the switch from centrally planned economy to market based economy in the central and eastern european countries by investing in the private sector, mainly banks, industries and businesses, and by promoting policies that would favor them. it was created as a result of the end of the cold war because of particular issues regarding the international system in place, the historical and political context at the time. furthermore, its recipient countries had to insure that they would work towards \"multi-party democracy and political pluralism\" in which was considered as one of the main particularity of the ebrd distinguishing the latter from other financial institutions. firstly, notably advocated by european political actors such as the french president mitterrand in 1989, the idea of creating this financial institution involving the european countries started before the fall of the berlin wall. the reception of this proposition was mitigated depending on the country, for instance it received hostility from the british whereas the french were important proponents of the project and influenced the process. in january 1990, negotiations about the ebrd objectives, its lending policy regarding the public and private sectors, started and involved all the eu countries at the time, as well as various other european countries, non-european countries and representatives from the eu and the european investment bank. the soviet union was represented by its own delegation in the process and thus participated in the negotiations as well as the usa. later on, because of dissensions on the political and economic objectives of the institution, the inclusion of the soviet union was threatened. considered as short negotiations, the agreement (for reasons relating to the situation in eastern europe and to a wave of privatization across europe) leading to its creation was signed on 29 may 1990 by actors such as 40 states as well as two european organizations and by march 1991 took its first effects as the bank was inaugurated. the creation of the ebrd has led to the financing of various projects in the years following its first operations, for instance there were twenty projects in 1992 in which the ebrd provided financing worth ecu 2.1 billion. stravinsky proved adept at playing the part of a \\'man of the world\\', acquiring a keen instinct for business matters and appearing relaxed and comfortable in public. his successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world\\'s major cities, including paris, venice, berlin, london, amsterdam and new york and he was known for his polite, courteous and helpful manner. stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high-profile partners, such as coco chanel. he never referred to it himself, but chanel spoke about the alleged affair at length to her biographer paul morand in 1946; the conversation was published thirty years later. the accuracy of chanel\\'s claims has been disputed by both stravinsky\\'s widow, vera, and by craft. chanel\\'s fashion house avers there is no evidence that any affair between chanel and stravinsky ever occurred. a fictionalization of the supposed affair formed the basis of the novel \"coco and igor\" (2002) and a film, \"coco chanel &amp; igor stravinsky\" (2009). despite these alleged liaisons, stravinsky was considered a family man and devoted to his children. \"turandot\" quickly spread to other venues: rome (teatro costanzi, 29 april, four days after the milan premiere), buenos aires (teatro colón, claudia muzio as turandot giacomo lauri volpi as calaf, 23 june, less than two months after opening in milan), dresden (4 july, in german, with anne roselle as turandot, and richard tauber as calaf, conducted by fritz busch), venice (la fenice, 9 september), vienna (14 october; mafalda salvatini in the title role), berlin (8 november), new york (metropolitan opera, 16 november), brussels (la monnaie, 17 december, in french), naples (teatro di san carlo, 17 january 1927), parma (12 february), turin (17 march), london (covent garden, 7 june), san francisco (19 september), bologna (october 1927), paris (29 march 1928), australia 1928, moscow (bolshoi theatre, 1931). \"turandot\" is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire and it appears as number 17 on the operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide. while the treaty of berlin (1878) awarded large parts of epirus to greece, opposition by the ottomans and the league of prizren resulted in only the region of arta being ceded to greece in 1881. it was only following the first balkan war of 1912–1913 and the treaty of london that the rest of southern epirus, including ioannina, was incorporated into greece. greece had also seized northern epirus during the balkan wars, but the treaty of bucharest, which concluded the second balkan war, assigned northern epirus to albania. after world war ii, via monte napoleone became one of the leading streets in international fashion, somewhat equivalent to paris\\' rue du faubourg-saint-honoré, rome\\'s via condotti, london\\'s bond street and oxford street, los angeles\\' rodeo drive, florence\\'s via de\\' tornabuoni, berlin\\'s kurfürstendamm and new york\\'s fifth avenue. there was an exhibition of price\\'s art in berlin from the 13th to 26 june 2008. in april 2009, a retrospective exhibition titled \"kids are all riot\" took place in shoreditch, london, coinciding with the release of his screenprint \"apocalypse angel\". several urban chinatowns exist in major european capital cities. there is chinatown, london, england as well as major chinatowns in birmingham, liverpool, newcastle, and manchester. berlin, germany has one established chinatown in the area around kantstrasse of charlottenburg in the west. antwerp, belgium has also seen an upstart chinese community, that has been recognized by the local authorities since 2011. the city council of cardiff has plans to recognize the chinese diaspora in the city. in 1922, john jacob astor, son of the 1st viscount astor, bought \"the times\" from the northcliffe estate. the paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of german appeasement; editor geoffrey dawson was closely allied with those in the government who practised appeasement, most notably neville chamberlain. candid news reports by norman ebbut from berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in london to support the appeasement policy. english operetta continued into the 1890s, with works by composers such as edward german, ivan caryll and sidney jones. these quickly evolved into the lighter song-and-dance pieces known as edwardian musical comedy. beginning in 1907, with \"the merry widow\", many of the viennese operettas were adapted very successfully for the english stage. to explain this phenomenon, derek scott writes,in january 1908, london’s \"daily mail\" claimed that \"the merry widow\" had been performed 450 times in vienna, 400 times in berlin, 350 times in st petersburg, 300 times in copenhagen, and was currently playing every evening in europe in nine languages. in the usa, five companies were presenting it, and \"the rush for tickets at the new amsterdam theatre\" was likened to \"the feverish crowding round the doors of a threatened bank\". stan czech, in his lehár biography, claims that by 1910 it had been performed \"around 18,000 times in ten languages on 154 american, 142 german, and 135 british stages\".the international embrace of operetta directly correlated with the development of both the west end in london and broadway in new york. american audiences were first introduced to operetta through gilbert and sullivan\\'s \"h.m.s. pinafore\" in 1878\".\" american operetta composers included victor herbert, whose works at the beginning of the 20th century were influenced by both viennese operetta and gilbert and sullivan. he was followed by sigmund romberg and rudolph friml. nevertheless, american operetta largely gave way, by the end of world war i, to musicals, such as the princess theatre musicals, and revues, followed by the musicals of rodgers and hart, cole porter, irving berlin and others. another notable operetta in english is candide by leonard bernstein. it was advertised as a “comic operetta. ” candide’s score in some ways was typical for its announced genre with some waltzes, but bernstein added the schottische, gavotte, and other dances, and also entered the opera house with the aria “glitter and be gay” baird set up the baird television development company ltd, which in 1928 made the first transatlantic television transmission, from london to hartsdale, new york, and in 1929 the first television programmes officially transmitted by the bbc. in november 1929, baird and bernard natan established france\\'s first television company, télévision-baird-natan. broadcast on the bbc on 14 july 1930, \"the man with the flower in his mouth\" was the first drama shown on uk television. the bbc transmitted baird\\'s first live outside broadcast with the televising of the derby in 1931. he demonstrated a theatre television system, with a screen two feet by five feet (60\\xa0cm by 150\\xa0cm), in 1930 at the london coliseum, berlin, paris, and stockholm. by 1939 he had improved his theatre projection to televise a boxing match on a screen by . jesse owens of the united states won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events, and became the most successful athlete to compete in berlin, while germany was the most successful country overall with 89 medals total, with the united states coming in second with 56 medals. these were the final olympic games under the presidency of henri de baillet-latour and the final games for 12 years due to the disruption of the second world war. the next olympic games were held in 1948 (the winter games in st. moritz, switzerland and then the summer games in london, england). honecker received additional high-profile personal recognitions including honorary doctorates of humane letters from north korea’s kim il-sung university in 1974, cuba\\'s university of las tunas in 1979 and iraq\\'s saddam university in 1983, honorary doctorates of business administration from east berlin\\'s humboldt university in 1976, tokyo\\'s nihon university in 1981 and the london school of economics in 1984 and the olympic order from the ioc in 1985. in september 1987, he became the first east german head of state to visit west germany, where he was received with full state honours by west german chancellor helmut kohl in an act that seemed to confirm west germany\\'s acceptance of east germany\\'s existence. during this trip he also journeyed to his birthplace in saarland, where he held an emotional speech in which he spoke of a day when germans would no longer be separated by borders, but unified under communist rule. this trip had been planned twice before, including september 1984, but was initially blocked by the soviet leadership which mistrusted the special east-west german relationship, particularly efforts to expand east germany\\'s limited independence in the realm of foreign policy. upon graduating, smith worked for the \"new orleans item\", with united press in london, and with \"the new york times\". in january 1940, smith was sent to berlin, where he joined the columbia broadcasting system under edward r. murrow. he visited hitler\\'s mountain retreat at berchtesgaden and interviewed many leading nazis, including hitler himself, schutzstaffel or \"ss\" leader heinrich himmler and propaganda minister joseph goebbels. in foreign policy, the labour party in power after 1935 disliked the versailles treaty of 1919 as too harsh on germany, opposed militarism and arms build-ups, distrusted the political conservatism of the national government in britain, sympathized with the soviet union, and increasingly worried about threats from japan. it denounced italy\\'s role in ethiopia and sympathized with the republican forces in the spanish civil war. those policies favoured the left but it also was pro-german. it consistently advocated negotiations with nazi germany, signed a trade agreement with it, welcomed the munich agreement of 1938 regarding the division of czechoslovakia, discouraged public criticism of the nazi regime, and pursued a slow rearmament programme. when world war ii broke out in september 1939, it recommended to london a negotiated peace with berlin; however after the fall of france in the spring of 1940, it did support the british war effort militarily and economically. following discussions in london in may 2008, us and libyan officials agreed to start negotiations to resolve all outstanding bilateral compensation claims, including those relating to uta flight 772, the 1986 berlin discotheque bombing and pan am flight 103. on 14 august 2008, a us-libya compensation deal was signed in tripoli by us assistant secretary of state david welch and libya\\'s foreign ministry head of america affairs, ahmed al-fatroui. the agreement covers 26 lawsuits filed by american citizens against libya, and three by libyan citizens in respect of the us bombing of tripoli and benghazi in april 1986 which killed at least 40 people and injured 220. in october 2008 libya paid $1.5\\xa0billion into a fund which will be used to compensate relatives of the other collaborators included arthur nikisch in berlin, and landon ronald in london. in 1841, for a la scala production, donizetti added a duet for tenor and baritone, \"e che mi valse...\", borrowing from earlier operas \"pia de tolomei\" and \"il diluvio universale\". other important premieres include madrid in 1833, lisbon and barcelona in 1834; palermo, genoa and bologna also in 1834; berlin in 1835; havana in 1837; vienna in 1841; london in 1841 (described as a \"failure\"); and rio de janeiro in 1850. playing for the indian senior team, pinto was to make his debut in olympic games, at the 1936 olympics in berlin. but, a serious concussion sustained at one of the final trial matches ruled him out of the games. however, he made his debut at the 1948 olympics in london, with the team winning the gold medal. he played in three of india\\'s five matches at the games and conceded just one goal. in the final against great britain, he scored india\\'s last and final goal in a penalty, thus having the distinction of one of the very few goalkeepers to score a goal. in matches he drew with rudolf loman (+4−4=2), won against james mortimer (+5−0=3), defeated samuel passmore (6:2), and drew with georg schories (2:2) at london 1904; defeated hector william shoosmith (+5−0=1), and lost to jacques mieses (+1−5=1) at london 1905; lost to spielmann (+4−6=5) at munich 1906; lost to frank marshall (+1–2=4), defeated nimzowitsch (+4–0=1), and lost to hugo süchting (1½:2½) at hamburg 1911, and drew with him (2:2) at hamburg 1912; won against moishe lowtzky (+5−1=1) at leipzig 1913; drew with hans fahrni (1:1), and won against jeno szekely (2½:1½) at munich 1914; and drew with curt von bardeleben (2:2) at berlin 1921. in dance, the galop, named after the fastest running gait of a horse (see gallop), a shortened version of the original term galoppade, is a lively country dance, introduced in the late 1820s to parisian society by the duchesse de berry and popular in vienna, berlin and london. in the same closed position familiar in the waltz, the step combined a glissade with a chassé on alternate feet, ordinarily in a fast time. the fame of the horse tamers recommended them for other situations where the ruling of base natures by higher nature was iconographically desirable. the \"marly horses\" made by guillaume coustou the elder for louis xv at marly-le-roi were re-set triumphantly in paris at the time of the french revolution, flanking the entrance to the champs-elysées in the 1640s, bronze replicas were to flank the entrance to the louvre: moulds were taken for the purpose, but the project foundered. paolo triscornia carved what seem to have been the first full-scale replicas of the groups for the entrance of the manège (the riding school of the royal guards) in st. petersburg\" (haskell and penny p 139). the standing of the heroic nudes had risen with the new approach to antiquity of neoclassicism: sir richard westmacott was commissioned to cast a full-scale bronze of the \"phidias\" figure, supplied with a shield and sword, as a tribute to the duke of wellington; it was erected at hyde park corner opposite the iron duke\\'s london residence apsley house, where some french affected to think it was the duke himself, stark naked. christian friedrich tieck placed copies of the figures, in cast iron, atop karl friedrich schinkel\\'s altes museum, berlin. in st petersburg, the anichkov bridge has four colossal bronze horse tamer sculptures by baron peter klodt von urgensburg (\"illustration, left\"). in brooklyn\\'s prospect park, at the ocean parkway (\"park circle\") entrance, stands a pair of bronze horse tamers sculptures (1899) by frederick macmonnies, installed as the newly combined city of new york was spreading across the long island landscape. according to recht, he and yotvat initially planned \"the apple\" to cost $4 million to produce, \"but when we were in london, menahem [golan] used to go like every week to berlin and come back with another million. and then we got to $10 million.\" this led golan to shoot scenes with settings that looked bigger than what recht wanted, which he was dissatisfied with. principal photography took place from september to december 1979 in west berlin. \"the apple\" editor alain jakubowicz claimed that, as with golan\\'s previous works, the original footage was around a million feet long, or four hours worth, and \"five to six\" cameras were used to shoot the musical sequences. the opening concert sequence was shot at the main hall of internationales congress centrum berlin and was filmed for five days in a row. the sequence for the track \"speed\" was filmed at the metropol nightclub, which held the guinness world record for biggest indoor laser show. the outside hippie scenes were filmed at schloss park, located in konigstrasse. some scenes in the film were shot in a factory that formerly served as a gas chamber during world war ii. conflicts between golan and recht took place when filming started; recht was still in london mixing the songs, and golan constantly made phone calls demanding him to be at the shoots in berlin. when he went to berlin to go to the shooting location, the first thing he saw was golan filming the uncut \"paradise day\" sequence that took a million dollars alone to make: \"he was shooting this part that never ended up on the screen because it was terrible. it was terrible. there was like fifteen dinosaurs on the set. i couldn\\'t believe my eyes.\" the scene was filmed at an exterior location at ccc film\\'s spandau studios, a studio which was also used as the location for boogalow\\'s penthouse. joss ackland, who portrayed mr. topps, recalled that the scene consisted of a combination of both real and \"phony\" animals and the mr. topps character was in a crevice making alphie and singing the song \"creation.\" multiple problems occurred shooting the sequence, such as the dinosaur pieces falling down and a tiger running from the set. the uncut scene also involved both mr. topps and the devil character mr. boogalow doing a dance together, which involved boogalow actor vladek sheybal falling on a river. in 1907, during his time at the conservatory, he wrote possibly his most famous work, the ballet \"le pavillon d\\'armide\". two years later, tcherepnin conducted the ballet at the premiere performance of diaghilev\\'s legendary ballets russes. he conducted for the entire first season and returned to conduct multiple times over the next five years. he conducted performances with the ballets russes in berlin, monte carlo, paris, rome, and the royal opera house at covent garden in london. in addition to his professorship and his commitments with the ballet, in 1908, he became conductor at the mariinsky theatre. at this post, he directed the paris premiere of rimsky-korsakov\\'s opera \"the golden cockerel\". the opera babes have performed in concert with orchestras such as the philharmonia, the halle, the royal philharmonic orchestra, the bbc concert orchestra, the royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra, the royal scottish national orchestra, the london symphony orchestra, and the berlin symphony orchestra, among others. they also performed for queen elizabeth ii at the festival of remembrance at the royal albert hall, the launch of the commonwealth games at buckingham palace, and proms at the palace for the queen\\'s jubilee celebrations. they have also performed at the los angeles opera house with plácido domingo, and were the first british classical act to perform in las vegas. in 2003 they performed beethoven\\'s \"ode to joy\" with andré rieu. they have performed on gmtv, \"des &amp; mel\", \"good morning america\" and \"fox and friends\". the opera babes have also been the subject of three uk documentaries for itv and one us documentary for cbs. since 2005, the opera babes have been ambassadors of sos children\\'s villages, an international orphan charity providing homes and mothers for orphaned and abandoned children. in 1900, riazanov went into exile. the next year in berlin riazanov and his co-thinkers established a small marxist group called \"borba\" (struggle), which attempted to unite the émigré russian marxists. riazanov\\'s group was excluded from the 2nd congress of the russian social democratic labor party that was held in london and brussels in the summer of 1903. with the party divided between bolshevik and menshevik wings in the aftermath of this landmark convention, riazanov and his co-thinkers pointedly declined to join either faction. after more than a decade of writing plays, sherman found widespread fame in 1979 with his first blockbuster hit, \"bent\". first produced in london\\'s west end starring ian mckellen, the play tells the story of max, a gay man in berlin during the weimar republic. after max and his boyfriend are forced to flee the city following the night of the long knives, the two live in hiding for two years before being captured by the gestapo and sent to a concentration camp. the play was considered extremely controversial. despite the uproar, \"bent\" transferred to broadway, where it starred richard gere and became an instant hit and was nominated for a tony award. following the success of this production, sherman moved to london. because of the economy and the remote location of los angeles, participation in the athletic events of the 1932 games was lower than that of 1928. the art competition did not suffer from this problem, and the number of art works entered remained stable. their exhibition drew 384,000 visitors to the los angeles museum of history, science and art. art contests were also held in berlin (1936) and london (1948), with reasonable success, although the number of entered works had significantly dropped by 1948. the son of william stokes, he was born in dublin, studied medicine there (m.d., 1863) and at berlin, london, paris, and vienna. in 1864 he settled in practice in clare st., dublin until 1878 when he moved to his father\\'s house in merrion square. in 1864 he was elected surgeon to the meath hospital. he resigned this post in 1868 upon his appointment as surgeon to the house of industry hospitals (which included the richmond hospital). in 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in europe – 500\\xa0km from berlin to frankfurt am main – and by the early 1850s the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in russia. in 1867, siemens completed the monumental indo-european telegraph line stretching over 11,000\\xa0km from london to calcutta. in 1897, siemens &amp; halske went public. from 1972 to 1981 he was principal director at the hamburg state opera. between 1977 and 1981, he was also director of productions at the royal opera house at covent garden in london, where he staged the first british performances of the three-act completion of berg\\'s \"lulu\". in 1981 he took up the post of general director of the deutsche oper berlin where he stayed until his death in 2000, staging productions across the whole of the operatic repertoire. he was born in berlin germany. as a teenager, decker lived in london, painting scenery in theatres; this was interrupted by the advent of the first world war, when he was arrested as an enemy alien and interned on the isle of man. in 1921, he changed his name to john decker and emigrated to america, where he worked as a cartoonist for the new york evening world until 1928, when he moved to hollywood and took up fine art. many film stars, including anthony quinn, errol flynn, charlie chaplin, greta garbo, and the marx brothers, commissioned decker to paint their portraits, and many of his works were used in films: the paintings of the frustrated artist protagonist in fritz lang\\'s 1945 film \"scarlet street\" were actually by decker. one of his most famous portraits, depicting his friend and drinking companion w.c. fields as queen victoria, hung for many years at chasen\\'s restaurant in west hollywood, california. an oil painting of john wayne, which wayne commissioned decker to paint in 1945, sold for $71,700 at a john wayne estate auction conducted by heritage auctions on october 6, 2011. like his friends fields and john barrymore, the years of seemingly endless drinking sprees wreaked massive abuse on his body, resulting in a premature death. decker died in hollywood on june 8, 1947, at age 51. decker\\'s mother maria anna avenarius (1865–1918) was an opera singer, performing wagner operas in berlin and bayreuth. her father, ferdinand avenarius, was an actor. decker\\'s father, graf ernst august (1867–1934), grew up in the castle ringelheim in salzgitter germany and became a reporter for british and german newspapers. his parents met in the opera of berlin and bayreuth. in 1897, two years after their son\\'s birth they moved to london and married in april 1898 in greenwich. on 4 august 2014, lord bates embarked on a 1054 mile/two month walk from london to berlin raising £41,000 for the german charity friedensdorf international (peace village international) who provide emergency medical for child victims of conflict. serenus de cressy, a confessor for the english nuns at cambrai, published a translation—probably in england—of the \"paris manuscript\" in 1670. copies exist in eleven british libraries, including the british library and dr williams\\'s library in london. there is also a copy in berlin, and three copies in the united states. having recorded the 39-minute single \"blue room\", the orb wanted to record a 41-minute album as their first studio record for island. their plan was to record one track and then \"mix it down into six very different versions.\" recorded in london and berlin from 1993 to 1994 using an expensive budget on behalf of island, \"pomme fritz\" was produced with adat (alesis digital audio tape), and group leader alex paterson also believes it to be the first orb album to use protools, which was operated on a mac. he later told popmatters that the album was recorded when the orb were being \"used and abused by bad management\" and his goal was to \"keep the orb\\'s dream alive.\" \"pomme fritz\" was the orb\\'s first album with german techno producer thomas felhmann, who has remained a part-time member of the group. kris weston\\'s role in the orb, meanwhile, became greatly diminished, as he is credited only as an engineer. his hymenoptera are in the natural history museum, london, with duplicates in the natural history museum, berlin. the lepidoptera were scattered and presumably sold. his \"parnassius\", the snow apollo butterflies, are in ulster museum, belfast. in 1981 oleg maisenberg emigrated to vienna. since then he has appeared with the israel philharmonic, the philadelphia orchestra, the london symphony orchestra, the vienna symphony orchestra, the berlin philharmonic, with the conductors christoph von dohnányi, zubin mehta, eugene ormandy, herbert blomstedt, stanisław skrowaczewski, neeme järvi, rafael frühbeck de burgos, georges prêtre, alain lombard, michel plasson, nikolaus harnoncourt, vladimir fedosejev, and esa-pekka salonen. the théâtre libre was the first of its kind and inspired the opening many theatres, including the freie bühne , (free stage), in berlin that opened in 1889 as well as the independent theatre society in london that opened in 1891. out of these two theatres grew freie volksbühne, (free people\\'s stage), and the stage society in 1899 and the abbey theatre at dublin in 1901. his first operetta was \"die kätzchen\", first produced in lemberg in 1890 and in vienna in 1892. his other works included \"husarenblut\" (1894, vienna), \"rhodope\" (1900, vienna and berlin), \"madame sherry\" (1902, berlin – his biggest success) and \"the merveilleuses\" (1906, london). as music director of musical director of the carltheater in vienna from the late 1890s to 1906, he imported several british works to vienna, adapting both librettos and

support artists such as claude monet, camille pissarro, and pierre-auguste renoir, he is known for his innovations in modernizing art markets, and is generally considered to be the most important art dealer of the 19th century. an ambitious entrepreneur, durand-ruel cultivated international interest in french artists by establishing art galleries and exhibitions in london, new york, berlin, brussels, among other places. additionally, he played a role in the decentralization of art markets in france, which prior to the mid-19th century was monopolized by the salon system. part of the success of impressionism was due to the international demand. durand-ruel established a network of galleries and exhibitions in many countries, with hubs in london, new york, and berlin. regarding the americans\\' open-mindedness towards impressionism, durand-ruel once said, \"the american public does not laugh. it buys!\" “without america,” he said, “i would have been lost, ruined, after having bought so many monets and renoirs. the two exhibitions there in 1886 saved me. the american public bought moderately . . . but thanks to that public, monet and renoir were enabled to live and after that the french public followed suit.” the convertible version began to be available to order in august 2011. as part of the product launch, beginning on 19 august, 500c by gucci car took a tour in

means of preventing such transfers, long managed to outwit the fuehrer by mailing out instructions to his english bank by writing on a postcard! by september 1938, robert recognized how dangerous hitler and the nazis had become, so: \"he went (to england) after the munich crisis, when many thought war would break out any second and met me (tania) in england. he had sent mother to bruges in belgium while he remained to cover the dramatic events for a couple of british papers (as well as his own) whose correspondents had left berlin. he was overworked and developed bronchitis and was ill when he arrived in london, having left the german capital at what seemed the last moment. he did not see churchill but saw men close to churchill, (men) who promised to pass on his message: if france and england acted immediately to show germany they meant war if it continued on its way, war would be averted. but this would be the last chance. another year, it would be too late, as germany would then be strong enough to take on the allies, in fact the world.\" robert edward crozier long, financial correspondent of the new york times and a contributor to the economist of london, died here

time the blitz finished as winners when it mattered. the final score was 37–21 making the london blitz national champions for the fourth consecutive year. dean bartlett cromwell (september 20, 1879 – august 3, 1962), nicknamed \"maker of champions\", was an american athletic coach in multiple sports, principally at the university of southern california (usc). he was the head coach of the usc track team from 1909 to 1948, excepting 1914 and 1915, and guided the team to 12 ncaa team national championships (1926, 1930–31, 1935–43) and 34 individual ncaa titles. he was the head coach for the u.s. track team at the 1948 olympic games in london, and assistant head coach for the u.s. track team at the 1936 berlin olympics. growing economic differences combined with developing political tensions between the us and the soviet union (which would eventually develop into the cold war) were manifested in the refusal in 1947 of the smad to take part in the usa\\'s marshall plan. in march 1948, the united states, britain and france met in london and agreed to unite the western zones and to establish a west german republic. the soviet union responded by leaving the allied control council, and prepared to create an east german state. the division of germany was made clear with the currency reform of 20 june 1948, which was limited to the western zones. three days later a separate currency reform was introduced in the soviet zone. the introduction of the deutsche mark to the western sectors of berlin, against the will of the soviet supreme commander, led the soviet union to introduce the berlin blockade to try to gain control of the whole of berlin. the western allies decided to supply berlin via an airbridge. this lasted 11 months until the soviet union lifted the blockade on 12 may 1949. santi was born in 1435 at colbordolo in the duchy of urbino. he was a petty merchant for a time; he then studied under piero della francesca. he was influenced by fiorenzo di lorenzo, and seems to have been an assistant and friend of melozzo da forlì. he was court painter to duke of urbino federico da montefeltro and painted several altarpieces, two now in the berlin museum, a madonna in the church of san francesco in urbino, one at the church of santa croce in fano, one in the national gallery at london, and another in the gallery at urbino; an annunciation at the brera in milan; a resurrected christ in the museum of fine arts, budapest; and a jerome in the lateran. after his time in congress, he served as a delegate to the inter-parliamentary union conferences in paris, france, in 1927, berlin, germany, in 1928, geneva, switzerland, in 1929, london, england, in 1930, and istanbul, turkey, in 1934, and as an observer in oslo, norway, in 1939, istanbul in 1951, and washington, d.c. in 1953. a second wirewalker album, titled \"2\", was released on 11 may 2012, through dot dash/remote control. collette and wirewalker also signed their first international licensing deal, with london-based fire records, who released the album worldwide (outside australia and new zealand) on 6 august. a media release said that while signifying that it was the second album released under that band name, \"the title \"2\" also refers to the fact that the album is essentially a collaboration between collette and talia, with regular wirewalker member ben bourke taking time off to be with his young family in melbourne.\" parts of the album were recorded with the two artists working separately—collette in berlin and talia in melbourne—although talia spent six weeks in berlin in mid-2011 to expand the recordings before collette returned to melbourne for final mixing. it features guest vocals by gemma ray and laura jean, among others. the album also features \"for roberto\", an instrumental tribute to late chilean writer roberto bolaño. the album received favorable reviews. hutcheson was born in melbourne, and toured there as a child prodigy at the age of five. he later travelled to leipzig and entered the leipzig conservatory at the age of fourteen to study with carl reinecke, bernhard stavenhagen (a pupil of franz liszt) and bruno zwintscher. he was part of the london music circuit in 1896 and 1897. prior to the outbreak of world war i he taught at the stern conservatory in berlin, but in 1914 he settled in new york city, where he made his us debut. elżbieta zawacka (; 19 march 1909 – 10 january 2009), known also by her war-time nom de guerre zo, was a polish university professor, scouting instructor, soe agent and a freedom fighter during world war ii. she was also a brigadier general of the polish army (the second and last woman in the history of the polish army to hold this rank), promoted by president lech kaczyński on 3 may 2006. sometimes called \"the only woman among the \"cichociemni\"\", she served as a courier for the home army, carrying letters and other documents from nazi-occupied poland to the polish government in exile and back. her regular route ran from warsaw through berlin and sweden to london. she was also responsible for organizing routes for other couriers of the home army. berlin game is a 1983 spy novel by len deighton. it is the first novel in the first of three trilogies about bernard samson, a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the british secret intelligence service (mi6). \"berlin game\" is part of the \"game, set and match\" trilogy, being succeeded by \"mexico set\" and \"london match\", and followed by the \"hook, line and sinker\" trilogy and the final \"faith, hope and charity\" trilogy. deighton\\'s novel \"winter\" (1987) is a prequel to the nine novels, covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters. but even before samson sets out on his mission, he is confronted with undeniable evidence that there is a traitor among his colleagues working for the kgb. clearly, it is someone close to the top, close to samson himself. it could be dicky cruyer, his incompetent supervisor - whom samson despises. it could be the american bret rensselaer, who has built his entire career around the work of brahms four — and who is spending an inordinate amount of time with samson\\'s wife, fiona (also an intelligence officer). it could be frank harrington, the \\'rezident\\' (head) of the berlin field unit. in fact, it could be any member of the senior staff at london central — even the director-general himself. artist pension trust announced that, beginning in september 2017, it would charge $6.50 per month for each work that members stored. the former ceo of the mutual art group, which includes apt, defended the fee, arguing that the cost is much less than artists will have to pay elsewhere. he told colin gleadell of artnet that “it’s not about raising money to balance our books; [it’s about getting] the work out of storage so that it can be seen and eventually sold. some works have been in storage for ten years and that’s not good.” according to brenner, the appeal of apt for some artists was the free storage facilities. in order to become a member, one originally had to agree to contribute to the storage expenses for oversize works when signing the contract, but the policy has never been enforced. in october 2017 seven former apt directors of the new york, london, berlin, and dubai trusts and 21 apt officials— put their names on an open letter expressing solidarity with the aggrieved artists. the letter expresses “deep disappointment in the direction apt is moving,” saying that the policy changes deviate from the original vision of the trust as they understood it. powell wrote the soundtrack for the movies \"ladyhawke\" and \"rocket gibraltar\" and has contributed to many other movie and tv

society. he subsequently spent 16 years in london. kontski settled in the united states in 1883 and resided first in buffalo, ny, then in grand rapids, mi and san francisco. he became a naturalized us citizen in 1892. two of his employees, paul reuter and bernhard wolff, later set up rival news agencies in london (the reuters news agency founded in 1851) and berlin (the wolffs telegraphisches bureau founded in 1849) respectively. in order to reduce overhead and develop the lucrative advertising side of the business, havas\\'s sons, who had succeeded him in 1852, signed agreements with reuter and wolff, giving each news agency an exclusive reporting zone in different parts of europe. this arrangement lasted until the 1930s, when the invention of short-wave wireless improved and cut communications costs. to help havas extend the scope of its reporting at a time of great international tension, the french government financed up to 47% of its investments. newman\\'s original new

newman\\'s company before beginning his own career as a choreographer. under difficult circumstances, with habitually low financial resources and extremely modest outside support, the dgss has nevertheless managed to hold increasingly successful national and international sexological congresses, establishing a close cooperation with most german and many foreign sexological societies. an impressive number of scientific publications, including many books and a book series (\"schriftenreihe sozialwissenschaftliche sexualforschung\", berlin/new york: w. de gruyter, since 1986; münster/hamburg/london: lit verlag, since 2003) give a fairly adequate impression of sexological research by the dgss and its members. blake was born in london. following national service, he learnt mandarin chinese and spent one year in hong kong. he went on to read music at gonville and caius college, cambridge, where his teachers were patrick hadley, peter tranchell and raymond leppard. he was

different posts at embassies in paris, berlin, st. petersburg, and london. he married a daughter of abdülmecid i, mediha sultan, which earned him the title of \"damat\" (\"bridegroom\" to the ottoman

novel in the first of three trilogies about bernard samson, a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the british secret intelligence service (mi6). \"mexico set\" is part of the \"game, set and match\" trilogy, being preceded by \"berlin game\" and followed by \"london match\". this trilogy is followed by the \"hook, line and sinker\" trilogy and the final \"faith, hope and charity\" trilogy. deighton\\'s novel \"winter\" (1987) is a prequel to the nine novels, covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters. the task of laying the delicate and elaborate groundwork for stinnes\\' defection propels samson from mexico to london, paris, berlin, and the east-west border. what happens along the way—a temporary abduction, an unnecessary murder, an inconvenient suicide—happens so fast that samson hardly seems able to keep london central informed of developments. or is it that samson wants to keep his colleagues in the dark? certainly london central\\'s entire senior staff—from samson\\'s immediate supervisors, locked in their endless internecine office warfare, to the dotty director-general himself—would have reason to suspect that samson might be working for the other side. he was, after all, closer than any of the other to the former traitor-in-their-midst. london match is a 1985 spy novel by len deighton, concluding the first of three trilogies about bernard samson, a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the british secret intelligence service (mi6). \"london match\" is part of the \"game, set and match\" trilogy, being preceded by \"berlin game\" and \"mexico set\". this trilogy is followed by the \"hook, line and sinker\" trilogy and the final \"faith, hope and charity\" trilogy. deighton\\'s novel \"winter\" (1987) is a prequel to the nine novels, covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters. \"london match\" concludes the story that began with \"berlin game\", where bernard samson\\'s wife fiona was unmasked as a kgb double agent and was forced into defecting, and that was continued in \"mexico set\", where bernard samson assisted the defection of erich stinnes, his kgb opposite number. for readers of len deighton\\'s three trilogies about the mi6 operative bernard samson (\"berlin game\", \"mexico set\" and \"london match\"; \"spy hook\", \"spy line,\" and \"spy sinker\"; and \"faith\", \"hope\" and \"charity\"), this is the story that started it all. the novel provides the historical background to several of the characters in the nine novels. it does this by introducing the reader to a minor character at least in this novel – who is a british intelligence agent, a character which recurs in different guises throughout the novel, including, for a brief period in the 1920s. this character, we learn, is brian samson, bernard\\'s father. the sufferettes is a multi-disciplinary comedy collaboration between becky johnson and kayla lorette. mostly known for their improvised comedy, they formed loosely in 2008 and began touring internationally in 2011. the duo has toured to

only the last of which survives, along with two films they made together in britain, \"calling mr smith\"(1943), an account of nazi atrocities in poland and \"the eye and the ear\" (1944/45), investigating the visualisation of music. in 1983 stefan, now living in london, made a reconstruction of \"europa\" with the london film-makers\\' co-op. an incomplete copy of the original film was found in an archive in berlin in 2019. following restitution to the themerson estate, it was donated to the british film institute for conservation and preservation. hillary then travelled north with the incognito prince, heading for berlin. after a period there, he left the prince\\'s employ and returned to london in the autumn of 1799. she moved to london, where she studied at the royal academy of music with harold craxton from 1933-1936. she herself became the subject of several legends. one of these involved her being set to learn, by craxton, the bach-busoni chaconne in d minor. she arrived for her lesson the next week and played the work from memory. craxton and others were astonished. she later explained that, as a student in berlin, she had a fellow pianist neighbour who played a certain work that she did not know, for several hours every day. she learned this work by musical osmosis through the walls, and it turned out to be the chaconne, which, until craxton gave the music to her, she had never before seen. the work became a great financial asset for her, as she could guarantee certain competition prize monies by playing it, frequently having spent the money before she luckily, and predictably, won. \"rogues\" made its debut at a pair of pre album-release shows at the london astoria and the berlin postbahnhof on november 14 and 16, 2006. leaving the cavalry, loder went into business with a german friend, walter becker, establishing a pickle factory in potsdam. later he began to develop an interest in acting. he appeared at the british theatre guild in berlin and enjoyed a triumph in productions of \"the last of mrs cheyney\", which had opened in london in 1925, and \"loyalties\". vladimir gavrilovich raitz (23 may 1922 – 31 august 2010) was a russian-born british businessman who co-founded the horizon holiday group, which pioneered the first mass package holidays abroad. born in moscow, his family were white russian jews who left the soviet union when he was six, and variously passed through berlin and warsaw before finally settling in london. march 5–22, 1908 paul cassirer organized another expo in berlin which included the painting peach blossoms in the crau lent by anna boch. cassirer first established a market for van gogh, and then, with the assistance of johanna van gogh-bonger, controlled market prices. in 1906 bruno cassirer published a small volume of selected letters of vincent\\'s to theo, translated into german. however, johanna was keen to maintain her independence, and contributed important loans to roger fry\\'s 1910 london exhibition, as well as to the important sonderbund exhibition of 1912 in cologne, where van gogh was introduced to visitors as \"the father to us all\". this was organized by an independent committee of artists, collectors and museum professionals, but was dependent on loans arranged by cassirer, the bernheim-jeune gallery and other art dealers. recent commissions have come from the berlin philharmonic (\"he\\'s got rhythm: homage to george gershwin\"), the russian national orchestra (\"wolf tracks and peter and the wolf\"), the manchester hallé orchestra (\"couleurs cuivres\"), the berkeley symphony (\"berkeley images\", \"luna tree\" and \"bremen town musicians\"), the philippine philharmonic orchestra (\"kobe symphony\", which was featured on david benoit\\'s 2005 release, \"orchestral stories\", on peak records), orchestre de paris (\"cordes et lames\"), the state of california (\"manzanar: an american story\"), the massachusetts institute of technology (\"nature suite\"), the orchestre symphonique de montreal, (shoka, diana damrau), the accademia nazionale di santa cecilia orchestra, (concerto for clarinet), the deutsches symphonie-orchester berlin, and the london symphony orchestra, (\"le petit prince\"). the ground-breaking ceremony was held between weinfelden and thur on 10 september 1909. 60,000 cubic metres of earth were moved. among the seven engineering structures to be built were four large structures. work on the bussnang viaduct was started late and the last section to be built was from the weinfelden mountain down to weinfelden because detailed approvals were delayed. the inspection of the iron bridges began in 1911. the thur bridge was loaded with three type b 3/4 tender locomotives of the sbb, each weighing approximately 85 tons. further investigations of the substructure and superstructure, the intersections of the railway with power lines, the structures and the rolling stock, finally allowed the opening of the wil–weinfelden–kreuzlingen–konstanz line on 16 december 1911. the weeg operated the line under contract. the contract for operations was transferred to vereinigte kleinbahnen ag (vka) of frankfurt am main in 1931. it sold its interest, in particular the interest-bearing bonds, to the ag für verkehrswesen in berlin wilmersdorf, with a small proportion going to the overseas trust corporation ltd. of johannesburg. a package of bearer shares had been issued to midland bank ltd. of london, but the vka bought them back in 1938. the contract for operations was temporarily suspended during the war years. after the first and second world wars, the mthb was an important source of hard currency for german counterparties in the periods of high inflation. the contract was terminated at the end of 1950 and the mthb took over its own operations. michael wilford cbe (born 1938) is an english architect from hartfield, east sussex. wilford studied at the northern polytechnic school of architecture, london, from 1955 to 1962, and at the regent street polytechnic planning school, london, in 1967. in 1960, he joined the practice of james stirling and in 1971 together established the stirling/wilford partnership. he designed the british embassy in berlin. during the cold war era (1945–1991), the west berlin air corridors, also known as the berlin corridors and control zone, were three regulated airways for civil and military air traffic of the western allies between west berlin and west germany passing over east germany\\'s territory. the corridors and control zone were physically centered on and under control of the all-allied berlin air safety center (basc) in west berlin. the airspace within these corridors was used by us, uk and french-registered non-combat aircraft belonging to these countries\\' armed forces and airlines operated by pilots holding those countries\\' passports. in addition, it was also used by lot polish airlines for regular scheduled services from warsaw to london and paris via schönefeld airport to the south of east berlin. hahn also drafted w.h.i. bleek\\'s unpublished grammar of otjiherero (\"entwurf einer grammatik der herero sprache\", 1854) , ultimately delivering his own version to riga in december 1854, and published its first dictionary, \"grundzüge einer grammatik des herero (im westlichen afrika) nebst einem wörterbuche\" (berlin/london, 1857) through the royal prussian academy of sciences. the latter, including a comprehensive grammar and a herero-german dictionary of 4,300 words, was the first publication using standard alphabet by richard lepsius, eventually causing much consternation over its suitability for transcribing a bantu language. during his visit to germany in 1873/74, university of leipzig awarded a doctor degree honoris causa to hahn for his research on the language of the herero, although his domestic servant and interpreter, urieta (johanna gertze) probably had a more than cursory role in the creation of his language studies and publications. in november 2009, abingdon boys school went on a tour through europe, securing a record deal with germany label gan-shin that saw their debut available in europe. the band played shows in helsinki, stockholm, hamburg, berlin, munich, paris, london and moscow. in london, the band played in camden underworld venue, famous in japan as it was the place where sadistic mika band had played in 1975, the first japanese rock band to ever tour in europe. although best known for his illuminated manuscripts, marmion also produced portraits and other paintings, altarpieces, and decorative work. a famous double-sided altarpiece with several \"scenes from the life of st bertin\" is in the gemäldegalerie, berlin (with two sections in the national gallery (london). there is a \"mass of saint gregory\" in toronto, and a \"lamentation of christ\" in the metropolitan museum of art, three works in philadelphia, and several others elsewhere. stylistically he lies between his french and flemish contemporaries, with a flemish innovation in composition and landscape. his perspective is usually technically sound, but the proportions of his figures are often awkward, and their poses rather stiff. before dateline, murphy was posted in nbc\\'s london bureau as chief foreign correspondent for today where his stories took him literally around the world: japan, thailand, india, africa, the middle-east and europe. his major assignments included the revolutions of eastern europe in 1989, german unification, the last days of margaret thatcher, funerals of the ayatollah and emperor hirohito. murphy was a frequent visitor to moscow in the turbulent times when mcdonald\\'s and gorbachev arrived and 75 years of an old order left. he was at the berlin wall the night the first west berliner climbed it in defiance of border guards below. murphy also covered the plight of the kurds in iraq following the gulf war and reported in the early 1990s from hot spots such as baghdad, bosnia and mogadishu. he won his first emmy for a report on revolution in romania in 1989. during the french revolution, he escaped to england, where he tended to the french catholic refugees in london. in 1793, he went to belgium. he had by now acquired a reputation as an effective preacher. with the arrival of the revolutionary army, he moved to germany, eventually settling in berlin. much of his time was devoted to spiritual direction. london and paris were the world\\'s only prominent financial centers throughout most of the 19th century. after 1870, berlin and new york grew to become major financial centres mainly serving their national economies. an array of smaller international financial centers found market niches, such as amsterdam, brussels, zurich, and geneva. london was the leading international financial center in the four decades before world war i. since then, new york and london have developed leading positions in different activities and some non-western financial centres have grown in prominence, notably tokyo, hong kong, singapore and shanghai. a longtime resident of manhattan and fire island pines, picano has resided for periods of time in los angeles, san francisco, london, england, and berlin, germany. he now lives in west hollywood, ca. he attended wesley college, perth high school from 1973 to 1977. holmes began his career at the \"daily news\" newspaper in perth at the age of 17. prior to his work at cnn, he was a reporter for more than a decade for australia\\'s nine network in perth, sydney, london and melbourne. he spent four years based in london, covering northern ireland, the first intifada, the fall of the berlin wall, the first gulf war and other major stories. after returning to australia he was later deployed to cover the rwandan genocide in 1994. weinberg was offered the position of head of the prestigious london beth din by chief rabbi joseph hertz in 1934. but following pressure from his students in berlin, weinberg turned the offer down, after which it was offered to dayan yehezkel abramsky who held the position for almost twenty years. born in kassel, germany, stürmer received his education in history, philosophy and languages at the university of marburg, at the free university of berlin and at the london school of economics. from 1973 to 2003 he held a professorship at the university of erlangen-nürnberg and at various times has served as a guest lecturer at the sorbonne, harvard university, and the institute for advanced study. also, he is on the advisory board of omfif where he regularly participates in various meetings regarding the financial and monetary system. magnus davidsohn ( – ) was chief cantor of the fasanenstrasse synagogue from its opening in 1912 until its closing by the nazis in 1936. a trained opera singer, he played the part of king heinrich in gustav mahler\\'s 1899 production of lohengrin. after leaving berlin in 1939, he helped found belsize square synagogue in london. he died in düsseldorf, germany, in 1958. qipao, as a style of the commodified women on the calendar posters reflects a society which objectified female bodies as a source of pleasure and turned them into tradable commodities which led to the rise of prostitution in shanghai. based on the data collected from the sociologist gamble: in 1917, shanghai had the highest population of prostitutes compared to other cities, such as london, berlin and beijing. records show that in 1935, there was 1 woman out of 9 - 15 female adults who resorted to prostitution in order to make a living. these numbers are the reason why wu chose shanghai as the goddess’ background, to depict shanghai\\'s submission to foreign forces and the fallen women of shanghai. on the other hand, prostitutes, as the visual harbinger of chinese modernity became the negative side of this metropolitan city, as their roles took on meanings of the \"victimized\" and the \"disorderly.\" the musical opened at the gaiety theatre in london, managed by george edwardes, on 15 may 1907, and ran for 303 performances. it starred george grossmith, jr., edmund payne and gertie millar. the young gladys cooper played the small role of eva. the show also had a broadway run at the knickerbocker theatre opening on 2 september 1908 and an australian run. one of the best known songs from the show is \"berlin is on the spree\". next to international conducting activities and cooperations with orchestras such as the berlin philharmonic and the philharmonia orchestra in london, wilbrandt became more involved in his own projects and recordings, concentrating on his work as a composer, especially in the field of avant-garde and electronic music. this led to developed experimentation regarding multimedia content and expression and to the constant exploration of new forms of music presentation. the shooting was first planned for the summer of 2007, but jovovich became pregnant. on may 22, 2007, a spokesperson of paul verhoeven announced that the shooting was postponed and would start in 2010. pursuant to the merger of gfm and seven arts, plans were announced to beginning shooting \"the winter queen\" in august 2011. filming locations are london, saint petersburg, and the babelsberg studios in berlin. in 2004, together with his partner-collaborator brian kenny, he co-founded superm, a multimedia art team responsible for site-specific gallery and museum shows in new york city, los angeles, moscow, berlin, london, oslo, bergen, haifa, and león, spain. peter sís was born in brno, czechoslovakia in 1949. his father was a filmmaker and his mother was an artist. he is the oldest of three siblings, has a younger sister hana and younger brother david, who became a film director after his father. as a teenager, sís developed an interest in western culture, allen ginsberg\\'s beat poetry, long hair for men, blue jeans and rock and roll, particularly the music of the beatles, the beach boys and the rolling stones. sís was educated at the high school of applied arts, the academy of applied arts in prague and the royal college of art in london, where he studied with quentin blake. when he graduated, he began a career as a filmmaker, later winning a golden bear award for an animated short, \"hlavy\", at the 1980 west berlin film festival. the station lies at \"one and a half depth\" because it is under buildings. like many berlin u-bahn stations, it has an island platform and entrances at both ends, north and south. all are stairways; the station has no lift. one of the two northern entrances is incorporated into a building on the corner of köpenicker straße, with offices and flats above. this building is also protected as an architectural landmark. the other northern entrance and the southern entrance, at the corner of schmidstraße, were also formerly incorporated into buildings, one of the models being entrances to london underground stations; neanderstraße was then unusually narrow and this line was the first use in berlin of entrances set into buildings. the other buildings were destroyed in world war ii and those stairs have since led directly from the street. oakes wrote the text for the television opera \"the triumph of beauty and deceit\" (1995) by the irish composer gerald barry, commissioned by channel four. in the summer of 2002 this was staged in a production by director/designer nigel lowery for almeida opera, at the aldeburgh festival and in london, and also performed in the autumn at the berlin festwochen. other opera texts she has written include \"miss treat\" for des oliver, staged by tête à tête in 2000, \"jump into my sack\" (based on a story by italo calvino) for julian grant, staged by mecklenburg opera in 1996, and \"solid assets\" for colin huehns, staged by the english national

bismarck, as well as the grandson of the german chancellor otto von bismarck and elder brother of german resistance figure gottfried graf von bismarck-schönhausen. bismarck was six when his father died and he inherited his family estate in schönhausen. a lawyer, he joined the diplomatic service in 1927, serving in stockholm (1927–28), london (1928–1937), with the foreign ministry in berlin (1937–1940), as envoy to rome (kingdom of italy) (1940–1943), and finally as head of the italian section of the foreign ministry (1943–44). elwes became the foremost english-born performer of the brahms \"lieder\" in the first decades of the 20th century. in january 1907, he made a singing tour of germany which included berlin, munich, leipzig, frankfort, and cologne, giving recitals with fanny davies (a celebrated pupil of clara schumann\\'s). he sang mixed programmes, but his performance of german \"lieder\", and especially of brahms, in german, was greatly admired. he was then singing such songs as \"komm bald\", \"am sonntag morgen\", \"salamander\", \"ein wanderer\", \"wir wandelten\", \"auf dem kirchhof\", \"magyarisch\", \"die kränze\", \"ständchen\", and \"botschaft\". he sang the brahms \"liebeslieder\" in brussels in 1908 with marie brema, and in london gave a recital with paderewski. in january 1913 at the queen\\'s hall, under henry j. wood, he sang mahler\\'s \"das lied von der erde\" in company with the contralto doris woodall: wood thought it \\'excessively modern but very beautiful\\'. brahms remained central to elwes\\'s repertoire to the end, and he also performed lieder of grieg, dvořák, and george henschel. early in his career he found an ideal accompanist in frederick b. kiddle, and they remained associated until his death. in concert, he has

chervonets is quoted on the new york stock exchange. throughout april, the chervonets stood at a level higher than its dollar parity. in 1924–1925, informal transactions with chervonets were carried out in london and berlin. at the end of 1925 the question of its quotation on the vienna stock exchange was solved in principle. by that time, the chervonets was officially quoted in milan, riga, rome, constantinople, tehran, and shanghai. the soviet chervonets could be exchanged or purchased in countries practically all over the world. during the first decade of the 20th century, urlus made a series of debuts in different european cities. they included: berlin (the berlin state opera); prague; vienna (the vienna state opera); munich (the bavarian state opera); stuttgart; dresden (the

giving occasional concerts in amsterdam and in scandinavia as well. from 1922 he sang at the new wagner festival at the zoppoter waldoper, helping to build its reputation as \"bayreuth of the north\". his operatic schedule diminished during the 1920s, however, as he accepted an increasing number of concert engagements. amsterdam, rotterdam, stockholm, copenhagen and berlin were all visited by him. when in berlin, he performed at the volksoper in 1923–24 and sang again at london\\'s royal opera house in 1924. the outcast band are a high-energy roots-rock band from stroud, gloucestershire. the band have played over 500 shows to audiences from london to berlin, at festivals including glastonbury, guilfest, wychwood, trowbridge, the acoustic festival of britain, and heineken big tops, as well as a 52 date uk university tour and a number of european festivals. at the start of 2010 he won the laredo 10\\xa0km race, but was second at the paralloop, losing his title to martin mathathi. he competed at the london 10,000 in may but again took the runner-up position, this time to british runner mo farah. kogo\\'s 10k world record was beaten by leonard komon in september 2010 and the grand 10 berlin race two weeks later presented kogo with an opportunity to go head-to-head with him. the victory went to komon and kogo had to content himself with fourth place in 28:24 (over a minute behind his rival). in europe, the british museum in london exhibits a series of famous yaxchilan lintels, and the museum der kulturen in basel, switzerland, a number of wooden lintels from tikal. the ethnologisches museum in berlin holds a broad selection of maya artifacts, including an incised early-classic vase showing a king lying in state and awaiting post-mortem transformation. the museo de américa in madrid hosts the madrid codex as well as a large selection of artifacts from palenque. other notable european museums are the rijksmuseum voor volkenkunde in leiden, netherlands, home to la pasadita lintel 2 and the leyden plate; the musées royaux d\\'art et d\\'histoire in brussels; and the rietberg museum in zürich, switzerland. luise krüger (january 11, 1915 – june 13, 2001) was a female, german athlete, who competed mainly in the javelin. she won the bronze medal for her native country at the 1934 women\\'s world games in london and the silver medal at the 1936 summer olympics held in berlin, germany, behind teammate tilly fleischer. she was born and died in dresden. after the event, the japanese team went on tour to warsaw, berlin, brussels, paris and london for competitions within the next half-month. his memorable appearances include performance at the royal albert hall in london, royce hall in los angeles and congress hall in berlin. in the summer of 1999, he was the featured soloist with the edmonton symphony orchestra in canada. his collaboration with different genres of music has been a very strong point as is evidenced by the enormously successful indo-persian venture, ghazal. their album, the rain, was nominated for a grammy award in 2004. violet rose olney (later \"parish\"; 22 may 1911 – 3 january 1999) was an english athlete from southwark, london, who mainly competed in the 100 metres. she competed for great britain at the 1936 summer olympics held in berlin, germany where she won the silver medal in the women\\'s 4 x 100 metres with her teammates eileen hiscock, audrey brown and barbara burke. the harp found its early orchestral use as a solo instrument in concerti by many baroque and classical composers (handel, mozart, boieldieu, albrechtsberger, schenk, dussek, spohr) and in the opera houses of london, paris and berlin and most other capitals. hector berlioz began to use it in symphonic music, but he found performances frustrating in countries such as germany, which had few harps or sufficiently proficient harpists. franz liszt was seminal using the harp in his orchestral music. the french and russian romantic composers particularly expanded its symphonic use. in opera, the italian composers used it regularly, and puccini was a particular master of its expressive and coloristic use. debussy can be said to have put the harp on the map in his many works that use one or more harps. tchaikovsky also was of great influence, followed by rimsky-korsakov, richard strauss and wagner. the greatest influence on use of the harp has always been the availability of fine harps and skilled players, and the great increase of them in the us of the 20th century resulted in its spread into popular music. in 1996, schuur appeared as a guest performer on sesame street. in an interview by elmo, she answered questions about how a blind person can learn to use other senses to get along in the world. in 1998, she was a special guest on \"ray charles in concert\", a benefit for the miami lighthouse for the blind. she performed at carnegie hall in a tribute to irving berlin in 1988, and again in 1996 in a tribute to ella fitzgerald. schuur gave a performance in 1999 to honor stevie wonder at the kennedy center honors. she sang \"i just called to say i love you\" arranged and accompanied by herbie hancock. entertainment writer jake elyachar rated this as one of the top 20 best performances ever given on the kennedy honors series. wonder was visibly emotionally moved by the performance. she was awarded the helen keller achievement award by the american foundation for the blind in 2000. late in 2003, schuur released \"midnight\", featuring original songs written by barry manilow for the album. manilow\\'s long-time songwriting team, which included co-producer eddie arkin, and lyricists marty panzer, bruce susan, and adrienne anderson, contributed to the project. manilow produced the album and also performed on it. the guest artists were brian mcknight and karrin allyson and it was backed by tony-winner bill elliott and the bill elliott swing orchestra. her second live album, \"diane schuur: live in london\", was recorded at ronnie scott\\'s, a historic jazz club in london\\'s soho district. scott\\'s is the site of previous live albums by ella fitzgerald and nina simone. financial woes led him to return to vilna in 1874, where he worked at the dvigatel insurance company and in draftsmanship, and soon became a leading figure in an underground circle of jewish socialists in that city. that same year he published a fictional satire entitled \\'the crux of the matter\\' in peretz smolenskin\\'s hebrew journal \"ha-shaḥar\" (\\'the dawn\\'). the vilna secret police issued a warrant for his arrest in july 1875; lieberman managed to escape, and settled in london in august after brief stays in königsberg and berlin. after clashes between the members of the union and the police, liebermann left london in december 1876, settling eventually in vienna under the false name of arthur freeman. he formed and led a group of authors who shared his views, such as ludvig levin jacobson, moshe kamyonski, isaac kaminer, and tzvi ha-kohen scherschewski. \"ha-emet\" (\\'the truth\\'), the first jewish socialist publication, made its debut in may 1877 with liebermann as its publisher and editor, thanks to the financial contribution of johann most. the viennese authorities shut the periodical down after the third issue and arrested liebermann in february 1878 on charges of carrying a false u.s. passport and setting up an illegal and subversive organization. after spending nine months in prison, he was extradited by the prussian police under anti-socialist laws and sentenced to nine additional months in prison in berlin. benjamin liebermann was a german textile manufacturer. he was born at märkisch friedland (now mirosławiec) on 4 february 1812 and died in berlin on 15 january 1901. in 1825 his family moved to the latter city; and liebermann, after completing a school course, entered the employ of a firm in london. upon his return to berlin he was taken into his father\\'s business, which he soon developed into the largest calico-manufactory in germany. that his ability was recognized is shown by the fact that he was elected to the presidency of the german merchants\\' association (deutscher handelstag). for many years he held the office of president of the gesellschaft der freunde, and he was treasurer of the lehranstalt für die wissenschaft des judenthums at the time of its foundation. the mill is a vfx and creative production studio headquartered in london, england, with three offices in the united states (new york, los angeles, chicago), one in germany (berlin) and one office in india (bangalore). it is owned by the company technicolor sa. the mill is a global creative partner for agencies, production companies and brands, working across all media channels and platforms. the mill produces visual effects, moving image, design, experiential and digital projects for the advertising, games and music industries. in january 2021, josh mandel became global chief executive officer of the mill after having initially joined the mill\\'s studio in los angeles as managing director/president in 2019. during the 1780s dülon toured constantly all over europe with his father and sister. during a visited to carl philipp emanuel bach in hamburg in 1783, he played the a-minor sonata to him who then commented that it was really odd that the king, for whom he had written that sonata, could not play it unlike the blind dülon. on the other hand, dülon suggested that bach play his \"hamburger sonata\" in g major, wq. 133 instead. he was also on friendly terms with karl benda, son of czech violinist and composer franz benda. in the summer of 1789, friedrich hölderlin took flute lessons with dülon in tübingen. up to 1787 his travels took him to leipzig where he played duets with johann george tromlitz, to berlin, where he met johann philipp kirnberger and johann friedrich reichardt, and also london, where he performed at court. ewan christian is mostly remembered today for his design of the national portrait gallery (1890–1895) in st martin\\'s place, london, just north of trafalgar square. however, the building, faced in portland stone, is not typical of his work and was built towards the end of his life, being completed shortly after his death. christian was an unexpected and controversial choice for such a commission and was appointed by the donor for the new building, w. h. alexander (1832–1905). in the autumn of 1889 the architect embarked on a study tour of continental museums and art galleries in order to prepare himself for the task, an exhausting project which included visits to bruges, ghent, antwerp, amsterdam, berlin, frankfurt, kassel and dresden. kun has had many exhibitions in israel and in new york, and also in london, budapest, sydney, amsterdam, paris, berlin, toronto, rome and brussels. leonhard frank (4 september 1882 in würzburg – 18 august 1961 in munich) was a german expressionist writer. he studied painting and graphic art in munich, and gained acclaim with his first novel \"the robber band\" (1914, tr. 1928). when a berlin journalist celebrated in a famous café about news of the loss of the ship rms lusitania, torpedoed by a german submarine, frank was upset – and slapped the man in his face. that is why he went into exile in

decides after to live abroad, first in france between 1969 and 1970 (lille and then paris), then in britain (london between 1970 and 1971), germany (munich, 1971 and 1972, berlin in 1974), spain (barcelona in 1973) and in the us (new york, in 1976) working as waiter, sweeper, night porter or kitchen boy. he therefore learns several languages (french, english, german, spanish) and keeps on

response to growing tensions in europe. it was originally hosted by veteran newsman robert trout and included short wave reports from london, paris, vienna, rome and berlin. when the show first went on the air it was hosted by veteran radio personality robert trout. the first show gave the world the voices of edward r. murrow and william l. shirer. in fact, it was the first time murrow had ever delivered a news report. during the early years of the war, murrow\\'s reports from london and shirer\\'s reports from berlin were essential listening to anyone trying to keep informed on events unfolding in europe. war correspondents, including members of the murrow boys, broadcast from around european throughout the war. it was at this point, as he was beginning his itinerant virtuoso career, that he met arthur rubinstein, through the invitation of juliusz wertheim. they immediately realised their shared musical sympathies, but the friendship, rich with youthful energy, really took off in 1907 with their concerts for the warsaw philharmonic, including duo performances of beethoven\\'s \"kreutzer\" sonata and tchaikovsky\\'s piano trio with the cellist j. sabelik. in 1908, with jozef jaroszyński (a patron of kochanski\\'s), they made a triumphant tour of european capitals, including berlin, paris, london and karlsbad, and in 1908–9 kochanski and rubinstein performed the

cochran\\'s production of cole porter\\'s musical \"nymph errant\" at the adelphi theatre in london. the décolletage formed by the low cut design of one of the costumes resulted in a strike by the chorus against the perceived indecency of the costume. theatre manager c. b. cochran was compelled to have the waistcoat altered to fill up the gap with gauze. in 1934, she designed the costumes for the broadway musical \"the great waltz\" at the center theatre, together with marion claire, marie burke and guy robertson. in 1935, she designed the costumes and sets for \"stop press\", the retitled london based version of the \"as thousands cheer\" revue by moss hart and irving berlin at the adelphi theatre. after the blitz, during the second world war, she designed costumes and sets for the old vic company productions of \"arms and the man\" and \"richard iii\" with margaret leighton, ralph richardson, sybil thorndike, joyce redman and laurence olivier at the new theatre. after several years of testing, a scheduled postal route between europe and south america was inaugurated in 1934. this was the first regularly scheduled airline service across an ocean in the world. \"wal\" flying boats were used, catapult launched for the trans-atlantic leg these were replaced by the dornier do 18 in 1936 making operations in non-visual conditions possible. the european network saw the introduction of the junkers g.38 (at that time the largest passenger aircraft in the world) on the berlin-london route via amsterdam, as well as the junkers ju 52/3m and heinkel he 70, which allowed for faster air travel. this was promoted by so-called \"blitz services\" (german: \"blitzstrecken\") between berlin, hamburg, cologne and frankfurt. in 1935, the first aircraft not manufactured in germany were introduced into the luft hansa fleet: two boeing 247s and one douglas dc-2. mosheim became established under max reinhardt, and in 1925 he gave her the chance to substitute in the play \"der sprechende affe\" by rené fauchois when the female lead became ill. mosheim learned the difficult role from albert bassermann in just 24 hours and became a superstar almost overnight. until 1933, when she went to london to escape adolf hitler\\'s rise to power, she was pre-eminent in the berlin theatre scene. she performed in a wide variety of roles, being equally at home in drama and comedy. she also appeared in musical revues and recorded songs by friedrich hollaender and others. mosheim was married three times: to actor oskar homolka in berlin (1928–1933), to industrialist howard gould in

have regular scheduled service operated by ryanair to london stansted airport. the service was announced on 27 may 2008, but ceased already one year later in may 2009. 264,247 passengers used the

and the sister of composer franz danzi. with her, he travelled extensively across europe: milan, paris, london, vienna, prague, naples, munich and berlin. the couple\\'s playing and singing complemented each other perfectly and arias with \"obbligato\" oboe were written for them, as for instance those in \"günther von schwarzburg\" (1777) by ignaz holzbauer, \"l\\'europa riconosciuta\"

beirut, berlin, london, warsaw and alexandria, and sales increased, particularly during the first world war, when allied troops passed through palestine. however, the businesses fell sharply when the war was over. the industry lost its principal markets in russia due to the october revolution, in the united states because of prohibition, and in egypt and the middle east because of arab nationalism. many of the vineyards were uprooted and replanted with citrus trees. equally sought after on the symphonic and philharmonic stages, she has appeared and recorded with the berlin

revolutionaries seized the first hen egg along with most of the other imperial eggs and sent it to the armory palace of the kremlin. a london dealer named either derek or frederick berry purchased the egg from russian officials around 1920, probably in either berlin or paris. christie\\'s of london sold the egg as lot 55 of the berry collection for £85 ($430) to mr alfred suenson-taylor in 1934. taylor was made lord grantchester in 1955, and the egg formed part of the grantchester estate when both lord and lady taylor died within months of one another in 1976. a la vieille russie of new york acquired the egg from the estate and sold it, together with the resurrection egg, to forbes magazine collection in 1978. viktor vekselberg purchased the first hen egg along with eight other imperial

love of dance music led him to begin djing whilst still working in his home studio. his first 12\" single \"motorcade\" was released by small, birmingham based label bostin\\' records under the artist name \"villa america\", the cover of the record was vivid claret and blue which ewan says had nothing to do with local football team aston villa. his success with his first few releases led to interest and eventually a long, successful deal with soma recordings. soon the remixes began to take over and it is here that ewan has had most success and indeed it is where he gets most of his professional satisfaction. he continues to successfully juggle djing and working in the studio. pearson regularly appears at fabric in london, manumission and space in ibiza, the pulp in paris, and panoramabar in berlin. the video features celebrities and anonymous people lip synching to the lyrics. the non-celebrities are filmed around the world, in front of iconic landmarks, such as times

live on stage; this shot was filmed on july 13, 2007, at the comcast center for the performing arts in mansfield, massachusetts. he was born 1939 in hatay province, turkey. after completing his primary education in yayladağı in hatay province, tarsus, mersin and antalya, he enrolled 1960 in istanbul academy of fine arts (today mimar sinan university of fine arts) to study painting. later, aksoy switched over to sculpture section, where he was educated by prof. şadi çalık between 1961 and 1967. following his military service, he served at the same academy as an assistant in 1969/1970. he went in 1970 to london after having received a state-granted scholarship for further studies. aksoy moved to germany to study at the hochschule der künste in berlin, from where he obtained a

the treaty of basel, he remonstrated; and in 1796, he left berlin, to which court he did not return till 1802. in 1802, he was appointed envoy at the prussian court. the rapprochement of russia and prussia in 1806 to a considerable degree is due to his work. in 1807, he was sent to london as an ambassador, but the peace of tilsit put his mission to an end. after completing his studies in 1983, kowalski was engaged as soloist at the \"komische oper\" in berlin. in 1984 he sang the title role in georg frideric handel’s \"giustino\", staged by harry kupfer. the artist drew international attention through his performance of orpheus in gluck’s \"orfeo ed euridice\" in a new staging of the work in december 1987, and in the travelling production by the komische oper in august 1989 in london. kupfer\\'s orpheus wears a leather jacket and carries an electric guitar in this innovative interpretation. adolf peter rading (2 february 1888, in berlin – 4 april 1957, in london) was a german architect of the neues bauen period, also active in palestine and great britain. the whitest boy alive started as an electronic dance music project in 2003 in berlin, but since slowly developed into a band with no programmed elements. the name of the band comes from the idea of a naïve, shy northern european boy that their music is about. the band\\'s german record label was bubbles. their debut album \"dreams\" was released on 21 june 2006 in germany. in july 2007, modular records signed them to their uk imprint and the band played their first uk performance with new young pony club at the london astoria in september 2007. the album was released in the uk with the single \"burning\" in november 2007. the band released their second album \"rules\" in march 2009. it was recorded in a newly built studio located on punta burros, nayarit, mexico. their single \"1517\" was also featured in the soundtrack of the video-game \"fifa 10\". he was elected as leas-chathaoirleach to lord glenavy in 1925 and as cathaoirleach (chairman) of the senate in 1928, he was vigorous in defending constitutionalism in irish life during a turbulent time and was engaged in a very high-profile contest with the president of the executive council éamon de valera in 1935 during the campaign to abolish the seanad, in which he was assisted by his brother george c. bennett, a teachta dála (td) in fine gael and later senator. he also played a significant role internationally, leading inter parliamentary delegations to berlin, prague, istanbul and london resulting in much economic benefit. in 2006, invited by the brazilian television network known as tv cultura, ricardo domeneck produced his first two videos. since then, his work has ranged from writing to the vocal performance of texts merged with video. in berlin, ricardo domeneck would begin a research of the poetics of performance and sound poetry of the dada movement, also translating poets hans arp and pierre albert-birot and poet-performers from the wiener gruppe (h. c. artmann, konrad bayer, gerhard rühm, etc.) into portuguese. the same year he produced his first video, domeneck started performing in experimental poetry festivals of cities such as buenos aires, madrid, barcelona and brussels, including performances museums such as the espai d´art contemporani in castelló and the museo reina sofía in madrid. the poet is also the co-founder of a collective of artists based in berlin, which organizes weekly performances and live acts at the club neue berliner initiative, including artists, musicians and bands such as kevin blechdom, wolfgang müller of die tödliche doris, jd samson and johanna fateman of le tigre, mystery jets, stereo total, mount sims, shunda k of yo majesty, bruce labruce and angie reed, among others. the collective is also responsible for the independent label kute bash records, which has released the london-based multimedia duo tetine. in video art, his interventions have been shown from nightclubs and galleries in europe to the public television in brazil. in both his writing and videos, ricardo domeneck concentrates on his own body as fixed set of materials. he gained big success in the official environment of turin for his civic and religious monuments. following the formative period in turin, he moved in 1922 to rome, and participated in important national and international exhibitions in milan, rome, venice, paris, london, berlin, dresden, monaco, brussels and saint petersburg, and received official recognition. commissioned by italian and foreign aristocracy in european courts, canonica created portraits and commemorative works. the master of equestrian sculpture also produced medallic art. in the first half of 1821 johann buschmann travelled to london, accompanied by his son friedrich, and agreed to a £1,000 contract with a mr. löschmann besides taking other orders for terpodions. on their return the buschmanns set up a workshop in berlin, eduard did stay in berlin and friedrich was on a tour through germany up to 1829 or even a bit longer. he was already skilled and experienced enough at musical instrument construction to begin building terpodions and aeolins as the letters written by him and his father make clear. the first evidence of the word aeoline we find in a letter dated 28 december 1828. moloney, the stairs expedition\\'s doctor, wrote up his account on his return to london in 1892. influenced by the writings of men such as livingstone, public opinion in britain began to clamor for reforms which benefited the indigenous subjects of the british empire. moloney noted that msiri had his \"apologists\" in london. king leopold had to legitimise his congo free state\\'s claim to katanga under the berlin conference\\'s principle of effectivity, so a justification for the killing of msiri was required. the stairs expedition\\'s reports were used in europe to emphasise self-defence as the reason for his death, coupled with the claim he was a bloodthirsty tyrant. moloney\\'s quotation of bodson\\'s dramatic dying words helped in this respect. the crusaders joined the european elite by reaching the eurobowl final in 1988, with upset wins over the london ravens and berlin adlers in the quarter and semi finals, only to lose against the helsinki roosters (35–14), who ran a power wishbone attack with mike kane, former all-american running back at csun. he scored 4 tds and was elected the game\\'s mvp. in 1989 amsterdam again reached the final, unfortunately losing a thriller 27–23 to the legnano frogs (italy). in 1990, the \"third crusade\" ended in manchester (uk) when the manchester spartans defended three drives from the crusaders in the 4th quarter to progress on their way to a european title. finally, the crusaders managed to claim the big prize. in 1991 the amsterdam crusaders won eurobowl v with a 21–20 win over berlin adler in offenbach, with safety najib nakad blocking a berlin pat to secure a hard-fought win. later that year the amsterdam crusaders played a regular season game against san francisco state university. a year later, eurobowl vi was added to the \"cru\" trophy cabinet with a 42–21 win over torino giaguari (italy) at uppsala, sweden. incredibly, 1993 saw the crusaders reach their 5th eurobowl final in six years, this time in the illustrious setting of the heysel stadium, brussels. in a fantastic game, the london olympians proved too strong for the crusaders. millar was hired by reuters in 1976 and worked in london and brussels before being sent from fleet street to east berlin by the news agency, where in the early 1980s he was the only non-german correspondent. millar also reported on the solidarity movement in poland before moving to warsaw and then moscow. he was born kurt otto adolf michaelis, a doctor\\'s son, in berlin on august 22, 1916, and educated at the falk real gymnasium. although baptised a lutheran, he had three jewish grandparents, which meant that after hitler came to power in 1933 he would not be allowed to study science - so his father sent him to london. in 1991, in the context of a study on behalf of the european commission in support of its regional policy, researchers criticized the idea of the blue banana as a desirable formation, but not an empirical reality, identifying it as the result of regional competition in europe. furthermore, their diagram of the blue banana had more of a curve, still including northern italy, but ending at barcelona. it also included paris, and had the anglo-scottish border as its northern stem. a study of the history of the blue banana as a concept refers to the commission\\'s study as a mistaken rejection of the blue banana from brunet\\'s original conception. from the research on the commission\\'s behalf, the blue banana represented a developed core at the expense of the periphery, whereas brunet empirically viewed the blue banana as a region of development at paris\\'s periphery, beyond the french borders. there are also considerations for an economically strong european pentagon with its borders paris, london, hamburg, munich and milan, with development axes towards the east (berlin, prague, trieste). paulson graduated with a ba in french literature and literary criticism from yale university in 1981, and attended the yale school of drama. from 1982 to 86 he lived in berlin and paris, writing novels; from 1987 to 93 he lived in paris, london and milan, shooting fashion and advertising photography. during this period he co-founded (with gilles dusein) the paris conceptual photography gallery urbi et orbi, and co-founded (with kurt novack) a graphic design studio, pourriture noble. in 2012, paulson founded agon ltd, which was accorded the exclusive, long-term rights from fide (world chess federation) to develop, organize and commercialize the world chess championship cycle. the first events were to be held in 2013 in london, lisbon, madrid, paris, berlin and istanbul. in october 2013 he was elected president of the english chess federation. he resigned six months later. \"breaking silence\" impressed numan such that he offered to produce an album for freud in the uk. because there was already a british band known as the radio stars, a name change occurred for freud\\'s backing band, who became known as james freud &amp; berlin. in october, they released \"enemy lines\" from \"breaking silence\". \"automatic crazy\", produced by numan, followed in march 1981. however, neither freud nor numan were happy with the london-recorded album and it was not released. one month later freud disbanded the group. after the publication of \"berlin society\", radziwiłł began to be seen with suspicion in berlin. when her father died in russia in april 1888, radziwiłł decided to stay in st. petersburg where her youngest son, casimir, was born the same year. at the russian court, princess radziwiłł had a prominent position. she became a friend and admirer of konstantin pobedonostsev. her political leanings being very liberal in berlin, turned to staunchly conservative in russia. she also began an affair with general peter alexander cherevin, court commandant, head of the third section of the okhrana, and one of tsar alexander iii\\'s few trusted friends. during the late 1880s and early 1890s, princess radziwiłł reached the pinnacle of her life and of her influence at the court. her situation suffered a sharp downturn with the deaths of tsar alexander iii in 1894 and of her lover cherevin in early 1896. estranged from her husband and children, she moved to london and earned some money writing articles for hungry american magazines and newspapers chronicling british society, but she accumulated debts. reports from cities such as prague and budapest showed odd mannerism and resistance toward modernization during a period of transition, as old european traditions, legends and monuments are deeply rooted in prague. reports on prague’s sense of national folklore and budapest’s ambivalent modernity demonstrate how the world\\'s old continent cities cope with cultural leveling. the german, along with foreign correspondents typically tend to share the \"new sobriety’s\" fascination with cultural leveling, while america was consistently referred to as the \"cultural model of the future\". mass culture and technological modernity are typically adopted by large major cities however old traditions place a strain on some cities when it comes to adapting to new trends. capital cities tend to imitate each other during the spread of cultural modernity. for example, \"in european capital cities, london was in the shadow of berlin’s progressive modernity, while prior to that berlin was in the shadow of paris.\" the ghost map: the story of london\\'s most terrifying epidemic\\xa0– and how it changed science, cities and the modern world is a book by steven berlin johnson in which he describes the most intense outbreak of cholera in victorian london and centers on john snow and henry whitehead. the second world war forced the monastic brotherhood to leave ladomirova and to evacuate to germany. vitaly appeared in berlin where, together with archimandrite nafanail (l\\'vov), he engaged in wide missionary activity amongst the russian refugees and prisoners of war. nafanail and vitaly then relocated to hamburg where they concentrated on the work of preventing thousands of refugees from being compulsorily repatriated to the ussr. in hamburg, hegumen vitaly began active church life at camp fischbeck. in the barrack-type church, the daily circle of divine services were conducted. simultaneously, vitaly began a small monastic brotherhood, and established a printing house which began to print badly needed anthologies from the church service-books for all the camp churches of germany. from 1947 to 1951, vitaly was prior of the london parish, where archimandrite anthony (bloom) serially served in one church. he has led orchestras such as the berlin philharmonic, vienna philharmonic, royal concertgebouw orchestra, chicago symphony orchestra, czech philharmonic, russian national orchestra, st. petersburg philharmonic, london philharmonic orchestra, bbc symphony orchestra, orchestre de paris, vienna symphony orchestra, and new japan philharmonic. in 1878 productions opened in london, berlin and vienna. the london production opened at the folly theatre, on 28 february under the original french title but with an english libretto by h. b. farnie and robert reece that closely followed the original. the production transferred to the larger globe theatre in august as \"the chimes of normandy\". edward solomon conducted; violet cameron and shiel barry starred as germaine and gaspard. it played for a total of 705 performances, setting a new world record for a musical theatre run, which was not overtaken until \"dorothy\", ten years later. the first berlin production opened in march 1878 at the friedrich-wilhelm-städtisches theater and the first in vienna was in september at the theater an der wien. bouchareb has also directed many feature films. his feature film debut came in 1985 with \"bâton rouge.\" his other films have also been recognized at film festivals and won several accolades. in

\"two men in town\", which both premiered at the berlin international film festival. bouchareb\\'s biggest success is likely \"days of glory\" (2006), which was entered into the main competition for the palme d\\'or at the cannes film festival, with the ensemble of actors all receiving the award for best actor in 2006. bouchareb described the filming experience as \"fixing an injustice\". the film has been cited as helping to release the pensions of several veterans from former french colonies after being frozen for years. also in 2006, bouchareb received the henri jeanson prize from the society of dramatic authors and composers (sacd) for his body of work. in february 2009, his film \"london river\" premiered at the 2009 berlin film festival, where the film\\'s main actor sotigui kouyaté receiving the silver bear for best actor. he has contributed poetry, fiction and non-fiction to several anthologies, including poetry society of india volumes, aesthetica quarterly review,

in leipzig and on 16 november 1935 at the meistersaal in berlin. the full ballet-score version premiered on 24 february 1938 at \"aulaen\" of the university of oslo. it was performed by the oslo philharmonic, enlarged to 100 performers, with tveitt as conductor, einar tveito as narrator, randi helseth as soprano, erling krogh as tenor and egil nordsjø as bass. selected parts were also performed in copenhagen and paris, before tveitt sent the score to london where it was set to be performed at covent garden, although this did not come to be. in 1927, her father bought her a bfw flamingo, registration number d-1120, and in july, she set off for the united states, the first of five trips. rasche first flew from berlin to paris (where she met richard e. byrd), then to london. she then flew to southampton where juan de la cierva assisted in loading her aircraft aboard the for the voyage to new york, alongside passengers cdr. byrd and clarence chamberlin. in the united

merit, with a number of publications. a linguistics historian from princeton university, hans aarsleff, notes that before frederick ascended the throne in 1740, the academy was overshadowed by similar bodies in london and paris. frederick made french the official language and speculative philosophy the most important topic of study. the membership was strong in mathematics and philosophy, and included notable philosophers such as immanuel kant, jean-baptiste le rond d\\'alembert, pierre-louis de maupertuis, and etienne de condillac. however, the academy was in a crisis for two decades at mid-century, due to scandals and internal rivalries such as the debates between newtonianism and leibnizian views, and the personality conflicts between the philosopher voltaire and the mathematician maupertuis. at a higher level, maupertuis, the director from 1746 to 1759 and a monarchist, argued that the action of individuals was shaped by the character of the institution that contained them, and they worked for the glory of the state. by contrast, d\\'alembert took a republican rather than monarchical approach and emphasized the international republic of letters as the vehicle for scientific advance. by 1789, however, the academy had gained an international repute while making major contributions to german culture and thought. frederick invited joseph-louis lagrange to succeed leonhard euler as director; both were world-class mathematicians. other intellectuals attracted to the philosopher\\'s kingdom were francesco algarotti, jean-baptiste de boyer, and julien offray de la mettrie. immanuel kant published religious writings in berlin which would have been censored elsewhere in europe. in november 1943 bomber command was ordered to carry out a sustained attack on berlin by air officer commanding (aoc) arthur harris. the offensive was dubbed the battle of berlin, through which harris was given an opportunity to strike a war-winning blow. in retaliation adolf hitler and hermann göring, commander in chief of the \"luftwaffe\", initiated operation steinbock. it called for retaliatory attacks on greater london. the operations were on a much smaller scale than the blitz in 1940–41, but it required a sizeable defence effort. burbridge took a mosquito nf.xii as his personal aircraft. it was equipped with a low-shf-band ai mk viii. these centimetric radar sets were mounted in a solid \"bull nose\" radome—a smooth nose which did not need external aerials. it required the machine guns to be dispensed with, but the fighter was still equipped with hispano-suiza hs.404s—20 mm caliber cannon. born in eastbourne, sussex (south england), he was educated at eastbourne grammar school, king\\'s college, cambridge, christ church, oxford, and guildhall school in london. he moved to germany in 1976 and worked firstly as a coach and chorusmaster at the deutsche oper berlin. from 1987 to 2001 he was artistic director of the rias kammerchor and worked with the berlin scharoun ensemble as a pianist and conductor and conducted the staatskapelle berlin and deutsches symphonie-orchester berlin as well as the akademie für alte musik berlin. despite missing the

member of the vermeer quartet and is the founder and a member of the michaelangelo quartet, where she performs together with mihaela martin, daniel austrich and frans helmerson. for young musicians from japan and the netherlands, she founded the \"east west baroque academy\". after graduating with a ba degree in economics from king\\'s college, cambridge, in 1989, tooze studied at the free university of berlin before moving to the london school of economics for a doctorate in economic history under the supervision of alan milward. charles b. cory described them as common in 1886 but shortly after its discovery, it became a favorite object for bird collectors. twenty-one specimens were collected on four occasions in total. the first four specimens were taken in august 1886. another three were killed in 1892 and one female was obtained in 1896. finally, thirteen specimens were shot between april and july 1916 by bird collector w. w. brown, jr. suddenly this bird was vanished and several surveys to find this species again have failed until zoologist c. bernard lewis observed one individual north of east end in the eastern of grand cayman in the summer of 1938. this was the last reliable report of a living grand cayman thrush. causes of its extinction were most likely deforestation and the destroying of its habitat by hurricanes between 1932 and 1944. stuffed specimens can be seen in the following museums: six in the field museum of natural history in chicago, one in the academy of natural sciences in philadelphia, two in the american museum of natural history in new york, one in the natural history museum of berlin, seven in the museum of comparative zoology, harvard university, cambridge, massachusetts, one in the natural history museum in london, one in the national museum of natural history in washington, d.c. and one in the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh, pennsylvania. gadow was born in stary kraków (pomerania), the son of an inspector of the prussian royal forests. he studied at the universities of berlin, jena and heidelberg. at jena he studied under ernst haeckel and at heidelberg university under the anatomist karl gegenbaur. after graduation he travelled to the natural history museum in london in 1880 at the request of albert günther, to work on the museum\\'s \"catalogue of birds\". gadow also established the first new sequence of bird orders and families that departed from earlier works in being based on phylogenetic principles based on a comparison of anatomical and morphological features and made use of the studies made by max fürbringer. this sequence was continued with modification by alexander wetmore and james l. peters and followed from the 1930s to the 1960s. gadow prepared volume viii on the titmice, shrikes and nuthatches, and volume ix on the sunbirds and honeyeaters. dodds made his maiden speech on 26 october 1945, reporting on a recent visit he had made to occupied berlin. he said that the children in berlin were living in refugee camps and were starving, and urged the government to provide more food for them. a year later, he was one of the three mps to visit greece as a delegation organised by the league for democracy in greece, a pressure group based in london. apart from dodds, the mps leslie solley and stanley tiffany were also members of the delegation. the delegation received the invitation to greece from general othoneos, who was then the president of the greek union of democratic associations, to come as guests of his organisation. the foreign office did not sponsor the delegates\\' visas on the grounds that their visit was private and not official, but the greek embassy in london authorised the visas nonetheless. the delegates split up into pairs, with dodds and the delegation\\'s secretary diana pym going to northern greece, speaking at the 1946 may day demonstration in thessaloniki, and visiting the women\\'s prison and surrounding villages. after several tours of the uk, guest performances in london\\'s west end and at international festivals, marchetto and sosthen’s show was nominated at the laurence olivier awards in 1993 in london for best entertainment. in the same year granada television celebrations produced paper marilyn, a one-hour documentary about marchetto\\'s life and his artistic career. at the first mtv europe music awards in berlin the following year marchetto joined together on stage with some of the same stars from his repertoire, including prince, george michael and björk. other international engagements followed: a four-month stint at the théâtre grevin in paris, a germany tour with erasure and an appearance at radio city music hall in new york city – just to name a few. in 1995 marchetto won the performance d’acteur prize at the cannes festival and in 1996 the fad sebastià gasch award in barcelona. at the beginning of 2006 marchetto continued his successful show in berlin and started on an extensive tour to italy. he performed for three weeks in rome and returned to his hometown to perform at a special carnival show at the teatro goldoni, filmed and broadcast by skytv several times. he also took part in various worldwide charities. at berkeley repertory theater in california his show was an absolute summer hit. marchetto ended the year with full houses in rome and a special christmas programme at the south bank centre in london, a show with many new pop icons, including lily allen, boy george as a street sweeper and a crazy vincent van gogh in the style of gnarls barkley. he graduated from yale university in 1895 where he had performed as a member of the yale glee club. after leaving school he studied music with horatio parker, edward macdowell, and gustav stoeckel. witherspoon also studied singing with walter henry hall and max treumann in new york city. for further study he traveled to europe. he worked in paris with jean-baptiste faure and jacques bouhy and in milan with francesco lamperti and also studied in london and berlin. \"mixmag\" praised the seminal single as an important step forward for british house music. the magazine declared, \"if any one record could be said to be responsible for finally making british house more respectable than its american and european cousins, \\'not forgotten\\' was it. no longer would british house heads be constantly looking over their shoulders at new york, ghent, milan and berlin. \\'not forgotten\\' and subsequent leftfield classics like \\'release the pressure\\' and \\'song of life\\' were the cement that welded a whole new british house scene together. london proudly joined the league of house capitals. british dance music has never looked back.\" dr theodor stiebel founded the \"eltron dr. theodor stiebel\" company at reichenberger strasse 143 in berlin\\'s kreuzberg district with a base capital of 20,000 reichsmark on 5 may 1924. according to the commercial register, the company began operating on the very same day. dr stiebel was loaned the capital for this by his uncles, hermann stiebel, who ran a hotel in hamburg and carl reese who owned a metalworking business (canning factory) in holzminden. with his patented invention of the first coil immersion heater, marvelled at by visitors to the 1924 spring trade fair in leipzig due to its rapid heat-up time and short cooling period, dr stiebel laid the foundations for the large-scale production that would begin one year later. the tln coil immersion heater was initially manufactured by 10 employees working in two leased buildings at reichenberger strasse 143 and oppelner strasse 34 in berlin. on 3 march 1925, production was moved to the third floor of reichenberger strasse 160. initially, only immersion heaters under the \"eltro\" brand were manufactured here, with an annual output of up to 60,000 units. in 1927, the company had 26 employees and generated an annual turnover of 184,745 reichsmark. its immersion heaters retailed for approximately three reichsmark at the time. additional space was leased in the building on reichenberger strasse from 1927 to 1932, and the first immersion heaters were also exported to australia, india, china and south america. the first foreign subsidiary began operating in london in 1927 and a branch was opened in zurich in 1929. the first two-stage small 1000 watts instantaneous water heaters with a porcelain casing went into production in 1928, with a daily output of 100 units. the instantaneous water cylinder was developed in 1931. the cylinder had a 3 litre capacity and the water heating was controlled by thermostats with two heating elements, each with a 500 watt output. in 2012 raven row gallery, london, revisited apg\\'s early years by staging a major retrospective of work carried out including examples of some of its placements together with related documentation much of it loaned by the tate. a further retrospective occurred in 2015 at kunstraum kreuzberg/bethanien in berlin, forming the basis for a further exhibition at summerhall, edinburgh in 2016. \"the watermelon woman\" premiered at the 1996 berlin international film festival and played at several other international film festivals during 1996 and 1997, including the new york lesbian &amp; gay film festival, l.a. outfest, the san francisco international lesbian &amp; gay film festival, the tokyo international lesbian &amp; gay film festival, the créteil international women\\'s film festival, the london lesbian and gay film festival, and the toronto international film festival. he returned to america in 1924 to appear in \"the passing show of 1924\" which ran for four months beginning in september. also in this timeframe he became a featured attraction with ringling bros. and barnum &amp; bailey circus and toured london, brussels and berlin. it was during an engagement at the london palladium that barbette was found engaged in sexual activity with another man. his contract was cancelled and he was never able to obtain a work permit for england again. john prince-smith (london, 20 january 1809 – berlin, 3 february 1874) was an english-born, german free trade liberal and politician. his name is also famous in connection with the collection of original socialist literature in vienna. menger collected everything that he could procure and began a book tour through paris, london and berlin, where his special socialist collection was unique in the world for the time. mengers private library was acquired by the sozialwissenschaftlichen studienbibliothek der kammer für arbeiter und angestellte für wien in the 1920s. she starred as fiona samson, the double agent and wife of bernard samson (played by ian holm) in the television adaptation of len deighton\\'s trilogy \"berlin game\", \"mexico set\" and \"london match\" (broadcast as \"game, set and match\"). she portrayed vivien leigh opposite anthony higgins as laurence olivier in the tv biopic \"darlings of the gods\". in 2004, she portrayed dorothy huber in \"they understand me in paris\", an episode of \"rosemary and thyme\"; dorothy was the wife of millionaire casper hubert. as well as advocacy and reform campaigns, the development of self-help and user/survivor controlled services is a central issue. the runaway-house in berlin, germany, is an example. run by the organisation for the protection from psychiatric violence, it is an antipsychiatric crisis centre for homeless survivors of psychiatry where the residents can live for a limited amount of time and where half the staff members are survivors of psychiatry themselves. in helsingborg, sweden, the hotel magnus stenbock is run by a user/survivor organization \"rsmh\" that gives users/survivors a possibility to live in their own apartments. it is financed by the swedish government and run entirely by users. voice of soul is a user/survivor organization in hungary. creative routes is a user/survivor organization in london, england, that among other support and advocacy activities puts on an annual \"bonkersfest\". in 1924 krauss continued his theatre career by joining the ensemble of the prussian state theatre in berlin. he again appeared on stage of the deutsches theater from 1926, as in strindberg\\'s \"a dream play\" filling five roles or as wilhelm voigt in the 1931 premiere of carl zuckmayer\\'s \"the captain of köpenick\". he also performed at the vienna burgtheater, and guest performances even brought him to london and on broadway in new york city, where max reinhardt staged karl vollmöller\\'s \"the miracle\" in 1924. one year later he debuted a first 20 hp omnibus model carrying up to twelve passengers on the route from braunschweig to wendeburg, operated by his own \"automobil-omnibus-betriebs-gesellschaft\". büssing busses soon served public transport in european cities like berlin (aboag), vienna and prague (\"fross–büssing\"), or london. born in coburg, oppenheim studied in london from 1899 to 1906. he moved to berlin and started his work as a graphic artist in 1910, signing his work with his initials, \"lo\" and working for clients such as aes, the reichsbahn, persil and adrema. his posters are considered a significant product of the \\'berlin poster style\\'. oppenheim worked for the type foundry berthold and created a handful of significant and widespread typefaces, all of which share modernist characteristics, such as lo-type and fanfare which are still in wide use today. also, he designed the first coin of the weimar republic in 1919. the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the subsequent move by central and eastern european countries toward market-based economies prompted the firm to launch its international expansion. it established offices in budapest, prague and warsaw in the early 1990s, followed by the establishment of offices in frankfurt, london, munich and paris. in the 21st century, the firm established offices in beijing, dubai, hong kong, and shanghai. one-quarter of the firm\\'s lawyers practiced outside the u.s. between 1871 and 1873, dannreuther studied music under heinrich de ahna and joseph joachim and theory under heitel at the berlin university of the arts in germany. after leaving school, he spent a few months in paris before moving to london, where his brother edward lived. he stayed there for 4 years before returning to the united states and settling in boston. he was among the violinists in the debut concert of the boston symphony orchestra at the symphony hall in 1881. not long after, he moved to buffalo, new york and became the conductor of the buffalo philharmonic society. while there, he met pianist ellen \"nellie\" morton taylor, a buffalo native, at concerts in which they both performed. they married on july 13, 1882 at st. peter\\'s episcopal church in niagara falls, new york. in 2016, the original line up of newby, keegan, hull and bateman began rehearsing together and went on to play several times, including the nyc popfest, the shiiine on weekender and concerts in manchester, berlin and london as well as a hometown gig as the headline band at the wigan diggers festival. in 1953, after three years in the raf, he returned to rada and was awarded the academy medal in the annual showing, also the sought-after prize of a year\\'s engagement at the doyen of british repertory theatres, the liverpool playhouse. after four years of widely-varied roles in three-weekly repertory in lancashire, where he also made the acquaintance of brian epstein, he returned to london, where he earned a high reputation in both bbc and itv television productions (when all transmissions were live), films and theatre. in 1962, he was invited by his idol, sir laurence olivier, (whom he had seen perform on stage in roles such as oedipus, sir peter teazle and hotspur) to be a founding member of the chichester festival and, one year later, an inaugural player of the national theatre of great britain, under olivier\\'s direction, at the renowned old vic theatre, which culminated in 1965 with knapp\\'s takeover of olivier\\'s star role as tattle in william congreve\\'s \"love for love\" at the scala theatre prior to the now legendary visit to both moscow and berlin in \"othello\", \"hobson\\'s choice\", and \"love for love\". his production of adventure-mystery continued upon the family\\'s return from europe in september 1933 but book sales fell as the depression deepened: \"murder runs in the family,\" new york, london, 1934 paris, 1938, \"scarred jungle\", new york, london, 1935, \"the whip-poor-will mystery,\" new york, london (as \"the new made grave\"), 1935, \"murder of a bad man,\" london, 1935, new york, 1936, \"the island of fear,\" new york, london, 1936, \"the dark ships\", new york, london, 1937, paris, 1938, berlin, 1951, \"the obeah murders,\" new york, london (\"murder in the sun)\", 1937, and \"sinfully rich,\" new york, london, 1940. according to ira nadel\\'s 1996 cohen memoir \"various positions\", cohen agreed to the project because there was a new generation of listeners and he was given complete artistic control; he picked the songs, designed the package, and insisted that the lyrics be included. the album was not a hit in the united states but did well in europe, cohen\\'s major market at the time. he toured in support of the album in 1976, beginning in berlin on april 22 and ending in london on july 7. it was during this tour that cohen recorded the funky, disco-infused \"do i have to dance all night\" at musicland studios. the single was only released in europe. mildred howard - (1945) - visual artist - mildred is an african-american artist known primarily for her sculptural installation and mixed-media assemblages. her work has been shown at galleries in boston, los angeles and new york, internationally at venues in berlin, cairo, london, paris, and venice, and at institutions including the oakland museum of california, the de young museum, sfmoma, the san jose museum of art and the museum of the african diaspora. howard was born in 1945 to rolly and mable howard in san francisco, california, and raised in south berkeley, california. howard has created numerous public installation works in the bay area and beyond. in 2017, a rent increase forced her to move out of the berkeley, ca studio where she had lived and worked for 18 years. born in exeter, sarah harrison is the second of three children of an army officer and a former actress, and a cousin of the novelist celia dale. the family spent time during her childhood in berlin, singapore, malaya, then germany again, before she was sent to boarding school at the age of nine. she took an english degree at the university of london and then worked for four years on the magazine \"woman\\'s own\", before becoming a freelance writer. scott is also active as a classical composer (having written a symphony, a ballet, four string quartets and a guitar concerto) and as a conductor. orchestras that he has conducted include the london philharmonic orchestra, the london symphony orchestra, the royal philharmonic orchestra, the munich symphony orchestra, the berlin radio symphony orchestra, the budapest opera orchestra, the lubliana radio orchestra and the prague philharmonic. there are paintings in the main galleries in london, munich (3), augsburg, berlin, cambridge, st petersberg, amsterdam (2), schwerin, milan, los angeles, dunedin and elsewhere. most of his altarpieces and decorative schemes can still be seen in situ. unable to cope with continued harassment by the authorities, walek dzedzej left poland at the end of 1978 and performed in the streets and clubs of london, paris, barcelona, berlin and finally vienna, where he remained for five months and appeared on a national tv program devoted to punk rock. he became judge of the berlin labour court, 1929. kahn-freund wrote a pathbreaking article, contending that the \"reichsarbeitsgericht\" (empire labour court) was pursuing a \"fascist\" doctrine in 1931. according to kahn-freund, fascism shared liberalism’s dislike of state intervention and preference for private ownership, social conservatism’s embrace of welfare provision for insiders, and collectivism’s view that associations are key actors in class conflict. in the case law kahn-freund presented, the \"reichsarbeitsgericht\" had been systematically undermining collective rights in work councils, demanding that trade unionists owed a duty to the \"betrieb\" (the workplace) which was indistinguishable from the employer. on the other hand, the court had demanded that individual workplace rights (for instance, to social insurance) were strongly protected. the article was shunned by the german legal academy and the trade unions at the time, but in retrospect has been seen as tragically accurate. kahn-freund continued working as a judge until 1933, shortly after hitler seized the chancellorship in coalition with the conservative dnvp. he found that radio workers were falsely accused of being communist and were entitled to maximum damages for unfair dismissal. he was then dismissed by the nazis in 1933. he fled to london and became a student at the london school of economics. they have recorded many cassettes and cds by h.m.v., music today, rhythm house, ippnw concerts berlin, navras and audio rec london. they have also sung for many television channels in india and have been broadcast on british, u.s., german and french radio as well. as well as being an integral part of all of india\\'s prestigious music festivals, the brothers have also performed at many important international music festivals and institutions in europe, u.s.a., australia, singapore, bangladesh, u.a.e. and hong kong. he has been touring continuously since the age of 17 and has resided in india, italy, france, uk and the united states. he was an invited visiting professor of ethnomusicology at the university of california, los angeles in 2003 and california state university at long beach in 2005. he has lectured at universities around the world, including college of dupage, umass amherst, uc santa cruz, princeton university, kent state university, dartington college of arts in london, hochschule der kunste in berlin and many other prestigious institutions. from 1980 to 1987, elia zenghelis was partner in charge of oma london; of oma athens from 1982 to 1987 oma athens. out of oma\\'s projects during that period, zenghelis was a central influence in earlier works: extension of the dutch houses of parliament, the hague, 1978; lutzowstrasse, iba berlin, 1981; parc de la villette, paris, 1982; and checkpoint charlie housing, iba berlin, 1990. luo jialun was born on december 21, 1897, in kiangsi to a moderately prosperous family. an industrious and precocious student, he graduated from peking university in the arts, and subsequently undertook intensive research work in history and philosophy at princeton, columbia, london, berlin and paris universities. returning to china he assumed a prominent role in the \"\"literary revolution of 1918\" and subsequent \"may fourth movement in 1919\" where as through his editorship of the respected journal \"the renaissance\". joining the university of peking he rose to become professor of history in 1926. in 1928 he was appointed president of tsinghua university serving until 1930. in 1920, fu went to europe to continue his education. his first stop was university college london. fu registered in the department of psychology and took most courses at undergraduate level. he also spent a considerable amount of time in medical school courses. in june 1923, fu traveled to berlin and studied at berlin university because the high inflation in germany after world war i gave him a favorable exchange rate. it seemed that fu never intended to obtain a b.a degree at these overseas institutions. instead, he advised his friends to utilize this rare chance to pursue as much learning as possible. the sinking itself was never photographed. mccay said that he gathered background details on the \"lusitania\" from hearst\\'s berlin correspondent august f. beach, who was in london at the time of the disaster and was the first reporter at the scene. the film was the first attempt at a serious, dramatic work of animation. target has made recent film profiles of artist tim storrier, iconic australian actor/director john bell, and theatre director simon stone (the talented mr stone). his feature-length documentary \"a town called brzostek\" won the award for best film at the ann arbor polish film festival and the 2015 humanitarian award, pffa chicago. it also won first prize at the warsaw and bucharest jewish film festivals, and was selected for the berlin jewish film festival 2015. translated into french and hebrew, the film has been shown in many countries, including in synagogues in oswięcim (auschwitz), paris and london, and to israeli students in tel aviv embarking on tours of poland. in 2014 hadid completed work on \"itarr el layl\" (\"the narrow frame of midnight\"), a feature film about a man in search of his missing brother. the main character zacharia, played by khalid abdalla, journeys through morocco to turkey and eventually to iraq during the second iraq war. the film premiered at the toronto film festival and went on to screen at various film festivals and venues, including the elinor bunin munroe film center at the lincoln center in new york, the rome film festival, london film festival and the walker arts center among other places. the film stars marie-josée croze, fedwa boujouane, hocine choutri and hindi zahra. in early 2015 the film won best film and critics prize at the tangier national film festival, jury prize at pleins les yeux in the netherlands, credit agricole prize in nice, france and the audience award for best narrative feature at the mizna film festival in minneapolis. in september 2015, hadid\\'s project \"house in the fields\" was selected to screen as a work-in-progress at the 72nd venice biennale international film festival where it was awarded two prizes. in february 2017, the film premiered at the berlin film festival where it was nominated for the glashütte original documentary award. the film was also the recipient of the commune di milano prize for best feature film at the fcaal milano film festival 2017, the firebird award for best documentary at the hong kong international film festival 2017, the fiction/non fiction best film award at the millennium docs against gravity international film festival in warsaw 2017, the

part of the ruben bentsov moving image collection at the walker museum in the us. she is a member of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences. upon arriving in london, henderson met the chancellor of the exchequer, neville chamberlain, who was due to replace stanley baldwin as prime minister the next month, for a briefing about the berlin mission. some controversy has ensued over just what precisely chamberlain told henderson. in his book \"failure of a mission\", henderson wrote that chamberlain \"outlined to me his views on the general policy towards germany and i think i may honestly say to the last and bitter end i followed the general line which he set me, all the easily and faithfully since it corresponded so closely with my own private conception of the service i could best render in germany to my own country\". henderson was to claim that chamberlain had authorised him to commit \"calculated indiscretions\" in the pursuit of peace, but the german-born american historian abraham ascher wrote that no evidence has emerged to support that claim. t. philip conwell-evans, a british historian who taught german history at königsberg university, later claimed that henderson had told him that chamberlain had made him his personal envoy to germany who was to bypass vansittart by taking orders directly from chamberlain\\'s office. regardless of what chamberlain said to henderson in april 1937, henderson always seemed to have regarded himself as directly answerable to 10 downing street and showed a marked tendency to ignore vansittart. on 16 march 1938, henderson wrote to the foreign secretary, lord halifax, to set out his view: \"british interests and the standard of morality can only be combined if we insist upon the fullest possible equality for the sudeten minority of czechoslovakia\". unlike basil newton, the british minister in prague, henderson initially advocated plans to turn czechoslovakia into a federation and wrote to halifax \"how to secure, if we can, the integrity of czechoslovakia\". at a meeting with vojtech mastny, the czechoslovak minister in berlin, on 30 march 1938, henderson admitted that czechoslovakia had the best record for the treatment of its minorities in eastern europe but criticised czechoslovakia for being a unitary state, which he argued caused too many problems in a state made up of czechs, slovaks, magyars, germans, poles and ukrainians. henderson told mastny that he felt that becoming a \"federal state\" was czechoslovakia\\'s best hope and wanted czechoslovakia to reorient its foreign policy upon \"prague-berlin-paris axis\", instead of the existing \"prague-paris-moscow axis\". in the spring of 1938, henderson formed an alliance with newton to work together to persuade decisionmakers in london to side with germany against czechoslovakia. when henderson sent newton a private letter praising him for his pro-german dispatches on 19 may 1938, the latter replied with a letter saying that he hoped henderson would \"be awarded the nobel peace prize and when that is done, i hope i may receive honourable mention. you have much the hardest job\". henderson was ambassador at the time of the 1938 munich agreement and counselled chamberlain to agree to it. shortly thereafter, he returned to london for medical treatment, returning to berlin in ill health in february 1939 (he would die of cancer less than four years later). sir oliver harvey, halifax\\'s private secretary, wrote in september 1938, \"nevile henderson\\'s very presence here is a danger as he infects the cabinet with his gibber\". in october 1938, henderson was diagnosed with cancer, which caused him to leave for london. from october 1938 to february 1939, the british embassy in berlin was run by the \"chargé d\\'affaires\", sir george ogilvie-forbes, a member of the scottish gentry and a protégé of vansittart. the dispatches from berlin changed markedly as ogilvie-forbes stated his belief that hitler\\'s aims went beyond revising the treaty of versailles towards winning germany \"world power status\". ogilvie-forbes wrote to london 6 december 1938 that based on the information he received, he believed that hitler would start a war sometime in 1939 with hitler divided only about whether it would be in western europe or in eastern europe. unlike henderson, who tended to gloss over the sufferings of german jews, ogilvie-forbes gave far more attention to nazi anti-semitism. ascher, himself a german jew, noted in ogilvie-forbes\\'s dispatches to london that there was a real sense of personal empathy with the sufferings of german jews, which henderson never displayed. after hitler gave his \"prophecy speech\" to the \"reichstag\" on 30 january 1939, ogilvie-forbes predicated that the \"extermination\" of jews in germany \"can only be a matter of time\". henderson, by contrast, wrote that \"jews and communists\" were the principal \"warmongers\"; british jews caused germanophobia in britain; jews around the world would \"move heaven and earth\" to cause an anglo-german war and \"jews, communists and the intelligentsia\" were the chief troublemakers in the world. to counter the negative reaction caused in britain by the \"kristallnacht\" pogrom, henderson during his stay in london suggested to herbert von dirksen, the german ambassador to the court of st james\\'s for the persecution of german jews to be \"regularized in an orderly and systematic manner\" to reduce the offence of british public opinion. when henderson returned to berlin on 13 february 1939, his first action was to call a meeting of the senior staff of the british embassy, where he castigated ogilvie-forbes for his negative tone in his dispatches during his absence and announced that all dispatches to london would have to conform to his views, and that any diplomat who reported otherwise would be removed from the foreign office. on 18 february 1939, henderson reported to london: \"herr hitler does not contemplate any adventures at the moment... all stories and rumours to the contrary are completely without foundation\". in february 1939, henderson cabled the foreign office in london: after \"wehrmacht\" troops on 15 to 16 march 1939 occupied the remaining territory of czechoslovakia in defiance of the munich agreement, chamberlain spoke of a betrayal of confidence and decided to resist german aggression. henderson handed over a protest note and was intermittently recalled to london. henderson wrote, \"nazism has crossed the rubicon of the purity of race\" by creating the protectorate of bohemia-moravia and that the seizure of the \"czech lands\" of bohemia and moravia \"cannot be justified on any grounds\". by late march 1939, there was a feeling in the cabinet that henderson could no longer effectively represent britain in berlin, but henderson was kept on for the want of a suitable \"grand embassy\" to send him to as a replacement. there was talk of sending henderson to washington, but there were objections that henderson\\'s tendency to commit \"calculated indiscretions\" would not mix well with the american press, which was inclined to report any indiscretions by public figures, whether they were calculated or not. the us state department made it clear to the foreign office that it felt that henderson would be an embarrassment in washington. when henderson asked for leave to visit canada in the spring of 1939, he was told that he would have to give to the foreign office copies of any planned lectures before he gave them since no one in the chamberlain government still trusted henderson to \"speak sensibly\" about germany. on 29 april 1939, the french ambassador in berlin, robert coulondre, reported to paris that when germany occupied the czech half of czecho-slovakia on 15 march 1939, that henderson, \"always an admirer of the national socialist regime, careful to protect mr. hitler\\'s prestige, was convinced that great britain and germany could divide the world between them\" but was very angry when he learned that the \"reich\" had just violated the munich agreement, as it \"wounded him in his pride\". coulondre went on to write: \"yesterday, i found him exactly as i knew him in february\". coulondre added that henderson had told him that the german demand for the free city of danzig to be allowed to rejoin germany was justified in his view and that the introduction of conscription in britain did not mean that british policies towards germany were changing. coulondre concluded that \"it appears that events barely touched sir nevile henderson, like water over a mirror... it would seem that he forgot everything and failed to learn anything\". henderson\\'s relations with coulondre were unfriendly and cold as the latter distrusted both henderson and weizsäcker, and unlike françois-poncet, coulondre refused to join the \"group of four\" that had met in 1938 to stop a war. by early may 1939, henderson reported to london that hitler still wanted good relations with britain but only if it ended \"the policy of encirclement\". henderson also added that he believed in the \"justice\" of hitler\\'s demand for the free city of danzig to return to germany and wrote that danzig was \"practically a wholly german city\" and that hitler did not want a war with poland, but one might break out \"if his offer to poland was uncompromisingly rejected\". after he had returned to london, henderson asked for another ambassadorship, but was denied. he wrote \"failure of a mission: berlin 1937–1939\", which was published in 1940, while staying at south rauceby hall, the home of an aunt in lincolnshire. he spoke highly of some members of the nazi regime, including \"reichsmarschall\" hermann göring but not ribbentrop. he had been on friendly terms with members of the astors\\' cliveden set, which also supported appeasement. henderson wrote in his memoirs how eager prince paul of yugoslavia had been to illustrate his military plans to counter mussolini\\'s projected assault on dalmatia when the main body of the italian royal army had been sent overseas. the historian a. l. rowse described \"failure of a mission\" as \"an appalling revelation of fatuity in high place\". henderson died on 30 december 1942 of cancer from which he had suffered since 1938. he was then staying at the dorchester hotel, in london. informed by his doctors that he had around six months left to live, he wrote an anecdote-filled diplomatic memoir, \"water under the bridges\", which was posthumously published in 1945. its final chapter defends his work in berlin and the policy of \"appeasement,\" praises chamberlain for being \"an honest and brave man\" and argues on behalf of the munich agreement on the grounds that britain was too weak militarily in 1938 to have stood up to hitler. it also asserts that if germany had invaded czechoslovakia, the latter would have fallen within a few months. on 13 february 1936 during a meeting with prince bismarck of the german embassy in london, ralph wigram, the head of the central department of the british foreign office stated that the british government (whose prime minister from 1935 to 1937 was stanley baldwin) wanted a \"working agreement\" on an air pact that would outlaw bombing, and that britain would consider revising versailles and locarno in germany\\'s favor for an air pact. prince bismarck reported to berlin that wigram had hinted quite strongly that the \"things\" that britain were willing to consider revising included remilitarization. on 22 february 1936 mussolini, who was still angry about the league of nations sanctions applied against his country for aggression against ethiopia, told von hassell that italy would not honour locarno if germany were to remilitarize the rhineland. even if mussolini had wanted to honour locarno, practical problems would have arisen as the bulk of the italian army was at that time engaged in the conquest of ethiopia, and as there is no common italo-german frontier. ernest julius walter simon, (10 june 189322 february 1981) was a german sinologist and librarian. he was born in berlin and lived there, being educated at the university of berlin, until he fled the nazis to london in 1934, where he spent all the rest of his life except for brief periods as a visiting professor in various countries, teaching chinese at the school of oriental and african studies, university of london from 1947 to 1960. he made great contributions to historical chinese phonology and sino-tibetan linguistics. as a sinologist, he had a chinese name, ximen huade (西門華德, xīmén huádé). in tournaments he was 6th at graz 1890, 6th= at vienna 1890, 1st at vienna 1891, 4th=

was born in british india, and was a member of the punjabi sehgal family, but \"had to flee from what is today pakistan when he was a child\"; his mother was \"a german native and homemaker.\" he studied political economy and dance at humboldt university, berlin and folkwang university of the arts, essen. he danced in the work of french experimental choreographers jérôme bel and xavier le roy. in 1999, sehgal worked with the dance collective les ballets c. de la b. in ghent, belgium, and developed a piece entitled \"twenty minutes for the twentieth century\", a 55-minute series of movements performed naked in twenty different dance styles, from vaslav nijinsky to george balanchine to merce cunningham, and so forth. he lives in berlin with his two sons. during his first year in berlin, phipps managed to see hitler only four times. phipps himself regarded hitler as something of a cipher or enigma; hitler was variously described in his dispatches back to london as more moderate than his followers or as possibly mad. in may 1936, phipps presented to hitler the famous \"questionnaire\", largely written by his brother-in-law, the under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, sir robert vansittart, that asked point-blank if germany intended \"to respect the existing territorial and political status of europe\" and was willing to sign \"genuine treaties\". neither hitler nor any other german leader ever responded to the \"questionnaire\". his father was benedikt hayum goldschmidt, founder of the bank and consul to the grand duke of tuscany. one of the richest families in europe, in 1900, after their father\\'s death, he and his brother, maximilian decided to close the bank and leave frankfurt. while maximilian, the later maximilian von goldschmidt-rothschild, moved to berlin, adolphe went first to paris and then to london, where he bought a large house in mayfair. he also bought a 2,500 acre (10\\xa0km2) country estate in suffolk. adolphe and his wife became collectors of art. they acquired many expensive pieces including the furniture of louis xv and louis xvi. at the same time, booka shade performed dance music live, with shows at sonar festival in barcelona, with mylo in london and a tour with röyksopp. booka shade also were the opening act of a depeche mode concert in berlin. this led to resident advisor awarding booka shade the honour of ‘best live act’ in 2006, alongside ‘best album’ for their new movements album. since 1995 he has been active as a live electronics designer working at ircam in paris, at the cirm in nice where he has also been studio manager and a freelancer. he has collaborated with numerous composers including james dillon, jonathan harvey, harrison birtwistle, fausto romitelli, luca francesconi, alejandro

large piece of the berlin wall (believed to be one of the largest in the uk after the imperial war museum london) is on display at the cornwall regimental museum in bodmin. a segment of the berlin wall forms part of a large monumental plaque, next to the memorial to ronald reagan in grosvenor square in mayfair, london. he has shown work in many exhibitions including at oldenburger kunstverein,

the opportunity to study the advanced techniques in cartooning. he also visited berlin, rome, vienna, geneva and paris. when he returned to india, the country was in the thick of freedom struggle. the dawn of independence also favoured shankar\\'s dreams for a separate periodical. the idea came true when pandit jawaharlal nehru released \"shankar\\'s weekly\", edited by shankar himself. however his cartoon also remained neutral often critical to his work, notable a cartoon published on 17 may 1964, just 10 days before pandit nehru death, showed an emaciated and exhausted pandit jawaharlal nehru, with a torch in hand, running the final leg of a race, with party leaders gulzari lal nanda, lal bahadur shastri, morarji desai, krishna menon and indira gandhi in tow, to which nehru remarked,

in private collections such as the saatchi gallery, london, daimler collection, berlin, fondation pinault, venice, and rubell family collection, miami. attaining sovereignty had become necessary in light of the rearmament efforts of the frg. for this reason, it was agreed that the treaty would only come to force when west germany also joined the european defense community (edc). because the edc treaty was not approved by france\\'s parliament on 30 august 1954, the general treaty could not come into effect. after this failure, the edc treaty had to be reworked and the nations at the london nine-power conference decided to allow west germany to join nato and to create the western european union (not to be confused with the western union or the european union). with this development, west germany, under the leadership of konrad adenauer, in front of the backdrop of the cold war became a fully trusted partner of the western allies and with the second draft of the general treaty, west germany largely regained its sovereignty. the allies, however, retained some controls over germany until 1991 (see further two plus four agreement). also, the end of the occupation regime in west germany technically did not extend to berlin (indeed the continuation of the presence of the western allies in west berlin was necessary and even desired by west germany given the cold war context), and the occupation of berlin by the allies was only finalized in 1994 under the terms of the two plus four treaty. in addition, although most of the world\\'s nations had ratified the 1906 berlin convention, the united states had not, and it was informed that because of this the u.s. would not be invited to the second international radiotelegraph convention scheduled to be held in london in june 1912. in response, on april 3, 1912, the u.s. senate ratified the 1906 convention. this followed by legislation implementing the convention\\'s provisions by the passage of the radio act of 1912, which was signed by president howard taft on august 13, 1912, and went into effect december 13, 1912. this new law greatly expanded government control over radio station licensing and operation. nyu

genre. the canary islands surrendered to their feet, and with andy montañez this act has recorded and performed for most people in occasions like carnivals, with certifications by guinness book of records. his political opponents, led by the national liberal eduard lasker, openly denounced his financing methods and his ties with the state government, enforcing the prussian trade minister count

and her own performances are all featured. the collection consists of more than 800 polaroids. ustinov went to school in jaffa, where until 1900 his father hosted the school of the protestant immanuel congregation in his \"hôtel du parc\", later in düsseldorf, and yverdon. he studied at grenoble university, in france, and worked at the university of berlin before he moved to london. that peripatetic life engendered in ustinov a cosmopolitan attitude, which made him averse to any kind of nationalism. hirsch was born in cologne in the german state of prussia on 21 september, the year being either 1852, as stated in newspaper reports of his death, or 1853, as stated in the biography prepared by his memorial committee. his father was a writer on economic subjects, and a member of the reichstag who ran into trouble with the german authorities due to his democratic principles. young hirsch was educated at a high school and also did some work at the university of berlin, but aged 19 began a career as a commercial traveller. before he was 20 he was sent to persia to buy carpets and obtained many fine old specimens. these were brought to london via russia. hirsch spent some time in italy studying art, and taking up his travelling again became a representative of british linen manufacturers. hirsch visited australia in 1879, and in the following year returned to germany. hirsch next went to ceylon and engaged in coffee planting and was also for a time a member of the civil service. while in ceylon he found that the rice tax was driving native cultivators off the land. his sympathies were aroused and he wrote several pamphlets on the question, which led to the removal of the tax. in 2009 he presented a performance at art basel, titled: \\'the big druid in his cubicle\\'; in 2010 his work was exhibited at kunsthalle, göppingen, germany in a group exhibition \\'happy end\\' curated by annett reckert; daimler contemporary gallery, berlin as part of \\'ampersand\\' curated by christian ganzenberg and an installation at hyde park shopping centre, london, uk. half a life is a 2001 novel by nobel laureate v. s. naipaul published by alfred a. knopf. the novel is set in india, africa and europe (london, berlin and portugal). \"half a life\" was long listed for the man booker prize (2001). alf hjort was born in christiania (now oslo), norway. he was a younger brother of norwegian oceanographer and marine zoologist johan hjort. their parents were johan s.a. hjort (1835-1905), a professor of ophthalmology, and elisabeth falsen (1849-1922) of the falsen family. after graduating from oslo gymnasium, he went to hannover in germany to study mechanical and electrical engineering. after work periods in berlin and london, hjort came to the united states in 1904. \"who\\'s the top?\", livingston\\'s first dramatic short film, premiered at berlin international film festival in 2005, and stars marin hinkle, shelly mars, and steve buscemi. the film, a lesbian sex comedy with musical numbers, also features 24 broadway dancers choreographed by broadway choreographer john carrafa. the film screened at more than 150 film festivals on nearly every continent, including theatrical runs at boston\\'s museum of fine arts and london\\'s institute of contemporary arts. in addition to conducting specialist new-music groups like the asko ensemble, xenakis ensemble, the composers ensemble, klangforum wien, the london sinfonietta, ensemble alternance, ensemble modern, and musik fabrik, he has worked with major orchestras including all the bbc orchestras, berlin symphony orchestra, stavanger symphony, orchestre philharmonique de radio france, netherlands radio philharmonic, orchestre de la suisse romande, the collegium academicum of geneva, helsinki philharmonic, bergen philharmonic, scottish chamber orchestra, hungarian state symphony orchestra, the sydney and melbourne symphony orchestras, the new zealand symphony, the hong kong philharmonic, and the rotterdam philharmonic orchestra. derges was born in london in 1955. having studied basic theoretical physics, she draws playfully on certain scientific theories in her artworks, such as the notion that in physics the observer\\'s decision affects what is observed. she began her artistic career as a painter working in london and berlin in the 1970s, studying painting at the chelsea college of art and design from 1973 to 1976 and at the slade school of art from 1977 to 1979. she moved to japan in 1980, where she turned to certain early photographic processes, camera-less photography—exposing images directly onto photographic paper. these techniques she has continued to refine and develop to this day. lynton was born to a jewish family in london on january 1, 1960. his parents, marion (sonnenberg) and mark lynton, were executives at hunter douglas in the netherlands. his father, born max-otto ludwig loewenstein, was born in 1920 in stuttgart, germany, and moved to berlin two years later when his father was named head of a major german car manufacturing company. he later enlisted in the british military, where he served for seven years and worked for the british intelligence, interrogating german officers. the family later moved to the united states and lived in scarsdale, new york, for several years before moving to the netherlands in 1969. in 1918 steel appeared on broadway in the musical \"the maid of the mountains\", which had been a hit in london, but closed in new york after just 37 performances. this was followed by his appearance in the ziegfeld follies of 1919, in which he was one of the show\\'s most popular performers. in the 1919 follies he introduced irving berlin\\'s song \"a pretty girl is like a melody,\" as well as singing \"my baby\\'s arms\" and \"tulip time.\" producer florenz ziegfeld is said to have paid him $3,500 a week for this show. in later years, irving berlin said that he had composed \"a pretty girl is like a melody\" with steel in mind. his paintings are mostly portraits or half-length groups of religious figures. he painted a live \"sparrowhawk\"(national gallery, london), which is probably a fragment of a larger work. the very early still-life of a \"still-life with partridge and gauntlets\" (alte pinakothek, munich) is often called the first small scale \"trompe-l\\'œil\" painting since antiquity; it may well have been the cover or reverse of a portrait (however, a fragmentary panel by another venetian, vittorio carpaccio, has a trompe-l\\'œil letter-rack of about 1490 on the reverse). in the gemäldegalerie, berlin there is a \"portrait of a german man\" and a religious subject. the louvre has a religious group, and philadelphia a pair of figures. each issue is the result of a research made in a number of different cities and locations of the world including dakar, london, berlin, copenhagen, oslo, basel, frankfurt, vienna and others. the history of rapid transit began in london with the opening of the metropolitan railway, which is now part of the london underground, in 1863. by world war i, electric underground railways were being used in athens, berlin, boston, buenos aires, budapest, glasgow, hamburg, istanbul, liverpool, new york city, paris, and philadelphia. it was as the representative of german jewry that wilfrid israel had described the details of nazi persecution to british diplomats and government officials visiting berlin, and also proposals for emigration to britain. a last desperate plea, following the kristallnacht, was made in london (together with two other german jewish leaders, paul eppstein and otto hirsch). this was rejected. however: another of wilfrid israel\\'s proposals, for the establishment of a transit camp in britain for young men released from the concentration camps, was accepted, saving eight thousand lives - a no less impressive rescue than that of the kindertransport. on nov. 9th , wilfrid israel telephoned dr. chaim weizmann, president of the world zionist organisation, in london. dr. weizmann immediately telephoned the foreign office. he was \"in considerable distress\" as he told of his information that the situation in germany had \"changed most dangerously during the last 24 hours\". the german jews thought that the only way to save the situation was for \\'some prominent non-jewish englishman to go over to berlin immediately\". on the same day anglo-jewry leaders representing the cgj, meet in london with sir michael bruce and request him to immediately go to berlin, meet with wilfrid israel and other leaders \"… who are only awaiting the arrival of a messenger to transmit reports on the treatment of our people.” the company\\'s other performance venues include the national theatre of ireland and the dublin theatre festival. blue raincoat has also performed at theatres in london, berlin, warsaw, madrid, bucharest and sofia. blue raincoat operate ongoing outreach programmes, national training seminars, internal training, the cairde community festival and music events. the son of a wealthy coal merchant of swedish origin, he claimed to be related to the painter victor emil janssen and the writer werner hasenclever. after serving as an officer in the german army between 1914-1918, janssen initially took up studying law in berlin. he then took vocal instruction from oscar daniel and made his debut at the berlin state opera on 5 may 1922 in schreker\\'s \"schatzgräber\", and became a member of the regular opera company there. initially focusing on italian roles in berlin, he began expanding into wagnerian roles during the 1923–1924 season in berlin, singing wolfram in richard wagner\\'s \"tannhäuser\". in 1925 he made a career breakthrough, again singing wolfram, this time at the waldoper in zoppot (now sopot, poland). between 1925 and 1937, janssen centered his career on berlin, zoppot, the bayreuth festival, and the annual grand opera season at the royal opera house in covent garden, london, adding to these regular appearances a number of guest performances at the vienna state opera, the opera garnier in paris (1931–1934), la monnaie in brussels (1934, 1935), and dresden, munich, the hague (1929), and barcelona (1928, 1929). as he began his employment with gchq in england prime received soviet radio messages at night, and was informed of a dead letter drop in esher, surrey. at the drop he found £400 and a note congratulating him. he used his minox camera to photograph documents and sent them using microdots to east berlin. other dead letter drops used were in abbey wood in south east london and banstead railway station in surrey. prime would use empty coca-cola cans to communicate at the drops as well as chalk marks on trees. despite his use of drops he preferred to meet his handlers personally as the drops were not sufficient for the large amounts of material he produced for them. glock was born in london. he read history at the university of cambridge and was an organ scholar at gonville and caius college, cambridge. he studied piano with artur schnabel in berlin from 1930 to 1933. in 1917, he became assistant naval attaché to haiti. in 1920, he was made a third secretary at the embassy in spain, a post he held for two years. he was chargé d\\'affaires in port-au-prince, haiti, in 1922–24. after other assignments, he became a first secretary at the american embassy in london. from 1928–1930 he served as the first person to hold the office of chief of protocol of the united states. in 1930–35, served as counsel to the commission for the study of haiti. dunn was chief political adviser to the berlin conference in 1945; deputy at the american meetings of the council of foreign ministers in london, paris and new york in 1945–46. henry soon gained worldwide recognition, with eight one-man shows at venues such as los angeles, berlin and heidelberg. following one of these, a 1984 exhibition at the commonwealth institute in london, he purchased a farm in ruwa, zimbabwe where he lived and worked until his death. the tour followed the release of the group\\'s album \"goats head soup\" on 31 august. it began at the stadthalle in vienna, austria on 1 september. it then saw, in large halls to mid-sized arenas, west germany, england (including four shows at the empire pool in london), scotland, switzerland, denmark, sweden, the netherlands, and belgium, finishing on 19 october with the band\\'s fourth entry into and thirteenth show in west germany, at the deutschlandhalle in west berlin, which would turn out to be mick taylor\\'s last live performance with the stones as a member of the band. altogether 42 shows were played in 22 cities, with two shows in a day a commonplace. harris became a leading manager of opera and ballet, notably at covent garden, london, but also in paris, berlin and st. petersburg. he wrote the libretto, with edmund falconer, for the opera \"the rose of castille\", with music by michael william balfe; it was produced in london in 1857 and on broadway in 1867. in the last four years of his life, he put on christmas spectacles at covent garden. the bank of amsterdam shut twice a year (january and july) for two weeks to balance its books; the account holders were expected to come and check their balance; for other business, they had to pay a fee. in 1763 the bank was closed from friday 15 july – till friday 29 july. the financial crisis at the end of july 1763 was triggered when leendert pieter de neufville had to pay his obligations to johann ernst gotzkowsky. on monday 1 august the wisselbank refused to transfer any money and de neufville suspended payment the next day. the shocking failure of de neufville caused the market to contract its lending to bankers; bankers to stop accepting bills and creditors to stop lending on the security of bills. their reaction caused financial contagion, a \"run behaviour, whereby fears of widespread financial collapse lead to the withdrawal of funding from banks and other financial institutions.\" the immediate victims were a group of independent, private \"cashiers\". (the deposits in the wisselbank were virtually unenforceable, but everyone was free to demand the money that he had entrusted to his cashier.) the deferrals resulted in an international banking crisis in amsterdam (38 bankruptcies), hamburg (90–97), berlin (33), danzig, leipzig, breslau, stockholm, and london. the bankers became unwilling to extend credit to one another, so that the failure of neufville led to a general loss of market funding. six leading amsterdam bankers suggested on 4 august to deposit their silver and gold bars at the wisselbank instead of coins. on 5 august, the banks were closed and all bills drawn on amsterdam were returned without acceptance or \"protested\". a run on the cashiers (bank tellers) followed on saturday, 6 august. the bank of amsterdam and the stadsbank van lening were open until two o\\'clock that night to accept gold and silver, which had never happened before. the bank of amsterdam\\'s improvised solution to the crisis was for the bank to expand its receipt window (much like a modern repo facility) to now include unminted silver bullion, a form of collateral that was in abundant supply after the prussian demonetization. the \"wisselbank\" introduced a new lending window that accepted bullion between 4–15 august. the amount of bullion went up in the next few weeks. after the seven years\\' war the stock of precious metals held by the wisselbank was never as large as in the years 1763–65, namely, 31 million guilders, of which no less than 25\\xa0million were made up of spanish specie, and send from hamburg. in the course of the 18th century english and french competition on the cadiz trade increased considerably, so that the dutch merchants, who used to occupy the first place, were pushed back to the third rank. the british credit crisis of 1772 the wisselbank funded a city-operated loan facility for distressed merchants. a fashion show (french \"défilé de mode\") is an event put on by a fashion designer to showcase their upcoming line of clothing and/or accessories during fashion week. fashion shows debut every season, particularly the spring/summer and fall/winter seasons. this is where the latest fashion trends are made. the three most influential fashion weeks are new york fashion week, paris fashion week, and milan fashion week, which are semiannual events. the london and berlin fashion weeks are also of global importance. in 1856, he began studies in classical languages and mathematics at the universities of berlin and halle/saale (ph.d. 1862), and concurrently with the university studies he pursued talmudic learning. settling in berlin, he was appointed principal of the talmud school, a position which he resigned in 1865 to accept that of the principal of jews\\' college, london, in succession to barnett abrahams. there he taught theology, biblical and rabbinical exegesis, talmud, jewish history, mathematics, and arabic. the freeform five dj mix albums \"bisous bisous ii\" and \"misch masch\" were released in 2005 and 2006. over the years, anu has remixed tracks for artist such as n*e*r*d, brian wilson, x-press 2 and david byrne, jamie lidell, justin timberlake, felix da housecat and the killers. freeform five continue to perform at clubs like fabric (london), manumission (ibiza), week end (berlin), razz (barcelona), paris paris (paris), lux (lisbon) and tours in australia, scandinavia, north america, mexico, brazil and japan. in 2006 the world athletics tour consisted of six iaaf golden league meets (oslo, paris, rome, zurich, brussels, berlin), six super grand prix meets (doha, athens, lausanne, stockholm, london (crystal palace), monaco), twelve grand prix meets (melbourne, dakar, osaka, belém, eugene, hengelo, ostrava, gateshead, madrid, helsinki, rieti, zagreb) as well as 26 area permit meetings all over the world. the world athletics final was held in stuttgart, having been staged in monaco the three previous years. since 1989, he has traveled widely in europe, south-west asia, and north america, and sojourned in various places, including amsterdam, paris, london, vienna, toronto, los angeles, new york city, and st. louis. he lives in berlin and, since 2013, in rome. klaus harmony\\'s background is presented as being in pop music, having spent his childhood in berlin accompanying his mother, lotte schmitt, a cabaret performer, on accordion at street corners. the aspiring musician then moves to the soho district of london in 1959, forming two accordion-led pop bands before meeting pop impresario peter wilde. harmony\\'s band subsequently becomes successful in the us and, in the late 1960s, rebrands itself as \\'kinky roosevelt\\', a progressive, heavy rock band. during the early post-world war ii years, charter flights using handley page hermes and vickers viking airliners, primarily flying out of blackbushe airport, constituted the bulk of airwork\\'s commercial air transport activities. these included a twice weekly series of flights on behalf of the sudanese government, which carried 10,000 passengers between london, wadi halfa and khartoum between 1947 and 1950, as well as a series of inclusive tour (it) flights under contract to the uk civil service, and flights carrying muslim pilgrims to and from jeddah during the annual hajj season. airwork was also among the uk independent airlines participating in the berlin airlift. since then, malfitano has sung at the major opera houses throughout the world, including the metropolitan opera in new york city, teatro alla scala in milan, royal opera house in london, théâtre du châtelet in paris, théâtre royal de la monnaie in brussels, grand théâtre de genève in geneva, teatro comunale in florence, gran teatre del liceu, berlin state opera, wiener staatsoper in vienna, bayerische staatsoper in munich, paris opéra, hamburgische staatsoper in hamburg, de nederlandse opera in amsterdam as well as the lyric opera of chicago, the san francisco opera, the los angeles opera, the houston grand opera and the salzburg festival. the field elm cultivar ulmus minor \\'webbiana\\', or webb\\'s curly-leaf elm, distinguished by its unusual leaves that fold upwards longitudinally, was said to have been raised at lee\\'s nursery, hammersmith, london, circa 1868, and was first described in that year in \"the gardener\\'s chronicle\" and \"the florist and pomologist\". it was marketed by the späth nursery of berlin in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as \"u. campestris webbiana\" , and by louis van houtte of ghent as \"u. campestris crispa (webbiana)\". henry thought \\'webbiana\\' a form of cornish elm, adding (presumably with petzold and kirchner\\'s 1864 description of loudon\\'s var. \"concavaefolia\" in mind) that it \"seems to be identical with the insufficiently described \"u. campestris\" var. \"concavaefolia\" \" – a view repeated by krüssmann. thirty four of the world\\'s leading policy institutes released a statement on 15 december that they would break off all relations with iran\\'s institute for political and international studies. signatories included the directors of the international institute for strategic studies in london; the aspen institute in berlin; the german marshall fund in washington; the geneva centre for security policy; the center for international studies and research in paris; the united states studies centre in sydney, australia; and the center for international relations in warsaw. the conference was condemned by the council on american-islamic relations (cair). monro \"secundus\" took his degree as doctor of medicine on 20 october 1755. he then proceeded to his studies abroad. he spent a short time in london, where he attended the lectures of william hunter. he next visited paris and on 17 september 1757 entered leyden university where he formed a friendship with two famous anatomists, bernhard siegfried albinus and petrus camper. however his foreign studies were prosecuted principally at berlin, where he worked under the celebrated professor meckel, in whose house he lived. alexander spent some time in edinburgh during early 1757 in order to fill the place of his father, who was confined to the house by illness. he finally was admitted a licentiate of the royal college of physicians of edinburgh on 2 may 1758 and as a fellow on 1 may 1759. he was to be elected president of the college in 1779. pines was born in charenton-le-pont near paris, and grew up in paris, riga, archangelsk, london and berlin. his father, meir pines, was a scholar and businessman whose sorbonne dissertation comprised the first attempt at a history of yiddish literature. mehta regularly performs the great roles of his repertoire with leading opera houses such as covent garden, bavarian state opera, opéra national de paris, théâtre du châtelet, la scala, theater an der wien, berlin state opera, la monnaie, netherlands opera, barcelona\\'s liceu, teatro real in madrid, metropolitan opera, chicago lyric opera, los angeles opera, san francisco opera, and new york city opera. he has performed at the festivals of salzburg, glyndebourne, edinburgh, aix-en-provence, and verbier, and at the london bbc proms. simms was born in hamburg \"of an old warwickshire family\", the son of frederick louis simms and his wife antonia née hermans. his birmingham-born grandfather had established a trading company there to support the newfoundland fishing fleet. frederick richard simms\\' first wife was austrian, his second, married 1910, was mabel louise, daughter of cotton merchant joseph worsley and they had two daughters, one of which was rosemary mabel who married the artist dennis ramsay. he was educated in germany and london and at the \"polytechnischer verein\" in berlin after completing an apprenticeship with \"ag fur automatischen verkauf\" in hamburg and berlin. tatiana echeverri fernandez was born 1974 in san jose, costa rica. she is a colombian artist and electronic sound producer. she now lives and works in berlin. echeverri fernandez works in several mediums including installations, sculpture, performance and sound. she studied at kunsthochschule kassel and the kunstakademie düsseldorf before moving to england to study at the royal college of art, london. since 2000 she has exhibited in group and solo shows internationally. as soon as improvements in techniques led to finer castings, designers exploited the decorative possibilities. as early as 1775, noted architect robert adam joined with the scottish carron company iron works to produce balcony railings in imitation of wrought iron, such as the railing for the adelphi in london (a pattern that was still produced into the 1830s). another very early large scale example is the delicate fence of the summer garden in saint petersburg, designed by georg von veldten, built between 1771 and 1784, which also imitated wrought iron, and is considered the pinnacle of cast iron design in the city. other well known architects were early adopters of the material; john nash employed cast iron as part of the structure of his landmark 1820s royal pavilion in brighton, and german architect karl friedrich schinkel was an enthusiastic early adopter, using cast iron for memorials such as the 20m tall gothic revival kreuzberg war memorial in 1821, and the delightful nautical seahorses and mermaids in the balustrade of the 1820s castle bridge in berlin. on 27 august, dahlerus flew to london, and met neville chamberlain, lord halifax, sir horace wilson and sir alexander cadogan. he presented an offer, which included a proposal that britain would agree to germany offering to guarantee the borders of poland, taking danzig and a referendum in the polish corridor. the very modest proposal was nevertheless felt to be unacceptable, and the poles would fight rather than agree to it. it was agreed that dahlerus would return to berlin and report with hitler\\'s reply. dahlerus had become so significant, according to his own testimony, that he felt able to advise the british government that they should keep ambassador nevile henderson in london until the next day so that he could better react to hitler\\'s response. hilda paredes has been commissioned by soloists, ensembles and orchestras around the world. her music has been performed by internationally renowned ensembles such as lontano, london sinfonietta, ensemble modern, neue vocalsolisten, ensemble signal, ensemble sospeso, and arditti quartet it has been widely performed at important international festivals, such as huddersfield in the uk; berlin philharmonic and eclat in germany; festival d\\'automne, cité de la musique, musica and octobre en normandie, in france; wien modern, in austria; akiyoshidai music festival, in japan; archipel, in geneva; de ijsbreker chamber music festival, in amsterdam; warsaw autumn, in poland; ultima, in oslo; melbourne festival, in australia; festival of arts and ideas and june in buffalo in the usa, ars musica in bruxelles; festival de alicante, in spain; festival internacional cervantino in mexico, amongst others. santhi\\'s case has been contrasted with that of caster semenya of south africa, also a middle-distance runner, who nearly lost the gold she won at the 2009 berlin world championship after she failed a similar gender test. semenya\\'s nation rallied around her to safeguard her dignity, her rights and position in world sports. she was also her country\\'s flag-bearer at the london olympics 2012. santhi supported semenya, fearing that semenya would face the same humiliation that she did. when she made her début in 1916, with the leipzig gewandhaus and the berlin philharmonic orchestra, under arthur nikisch, the critics made no allowance for her youth, but spoke of her work as the equal of that of the most famous of the younger generation of violinists. on the voyage from europe to new york, morini and her cousin louis played violin and clarinet for the first class passengers aboard the ship, and were given first class accommodations on account of their popularity. her american début at the age of seventeen in new york (january 26, 1921) was one of the musical sensations of the year. shortly after her new york début, she was presented with the guadagnini violin which had been owned by the celebrated american violinist maud powell, who had died in 1920. in march 1921, morini made her first recordings for the victor talking machine company in camden, new jersey, accompanied on the piano by her sister, alice. she made her first visit to london in 1923. in 1904, slovene impressionists rihard jakopič, matej sternen, matija jama and ivan grohar himself, exhibited in the mietke gallery in vienna as the artists’ club \"sava\". they enjoyed great success and sold several paintings. later, grohar exhibited in the secession in vienna, in belgrade, london, krakow, warsaw, trieste, duino, berlin, and elsewhere. despite this, he always had financial difficulties. in 1911, after interventions of the politician janez evangelist krek and the painter rihard jakopič, the sorica municipal council granted him 2000 crowns for a study trip to italy. he then went to ljubljana in order to buy everything that he would need for the trip, but he was so afflicted by illness, which he had been keeping secret, that he was delivered to the state hospital in ljubljana, where he died of tuberculosis. he left behind a series of priceless artworks and a number of debts, which rihard jakopič settled for him. jakopič was preparing his sixth artists’ exhibition in his artists’ pavilion, which was dedicated to the memory of ivan grohar. it has a network of more than forty correspondents around the world. it hosts conferences, including the annual european film finance summit in berlin and the uk film finance conference in london. according to a cable from the u.s. embassy in ashgabat, berdimuhamedow is married and has three daughters and one son. one of his sons-in-law, yhlasgeldi amanov, headed the turkmen state agency for management and use of hydrocarbon resources in london, was later assigned to the turkmenistan embassies in berlin and london, and as of 23 november 2019 was turkmenistan\\'s consul general in dubai. the other son-in-law is also a diplomat, with a prior posting in paris, but later assigned to brussels. the counterculture movement took hold in western europe, with london, amsterdam, paris, rome and milan, copenhagen and west berlin rivaling san francisco and new york as counterculture centers.'"
