      "born in pesaro to parents who were both musicians (his father a trumpeter, his mother a singer), rossini began to compose by the age of 12 and was educated at music school in bologna. his first opera was performed in venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old. in 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in naples. in the period 1810–1823 he wrote 34 operas for the italian stage that were performed in venice, milan, ferrara, naples and elsewhere; this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components (such as overtures) and a certain amount of self-borrowing. during this period he produced his most popular works, including the comic operas 'l'italiana in algeri', 'il barbiere di siviglia' (known in english as 'the barber of seville') and 'la cenerentola', which brought to a peak the 'opera buffa' tradition he inherited from masters such as domenico cimarosa and giovanni paisiello. he also composed 'opera seria' works such as 'otello', 'tancredi' and 'semiramide'. all of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody, harmonic and instrumental colour, and dramatic form. in 1824 he was contracted by the opéra in paris, for which he produced an opera to celebrate the coronation of charles x, 'il viaggio a reims' (later cannibalised for his first opera in french, 'le comte ory'), revisions of two of his italian operas, 'le siège de corinthe' and 'moïse', and in 1829 his last opera, 'guillaume tell'.\n",

      "by now, rossini's career was arousing interest across europe. others came to italy to study the revival of italian opera and used its lessons to advance themselves; amongst these was the berlin-born giacomo meyerbeer who arrived in italy in 1816, a year after rossini's establishment at naples, and lived and worked there until following him to paris in 1825; he used one of rossini's librettists, gaetano rossi, for five of his seven italian operas, which were produced at turin, venice and milan. in a letter to his brother of september 1818, he includes a detailed critique of 'otello' from the point of view of a non-italian informed observer. he is scathing about the self-borrowings in the first two acts, but concedes that the third act 'so firmly established rossini's reputation in venice that even a thousand follies could not rob him of it. but this act is divinely beautiful, and what is so strange is that [its] beauties ... are blatantly un-rossinian: outstanding, even passionate recitatives, mysterious accompaniments, lots of local colour.'\n",

      "in france, historical painting on idealized medieval and renaissance themes is known as the 'style troubadour', a term with no equivalent for other countries, though the same trends occurred there. delacroix, ingres and richard parkes bonington all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as pierre-henri révoil (1776–1842) and fleury-françois richard (1777–1852). their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. the lives of great artists such as raphael were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. fleury-richard's 'valentine of milan weeping for the death of her husband', shown in the paris salon of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like paul delaroche.\n",

      "stendhal was a dandy and wit about town in paris, as well as an obsessive womaniser. his genuine empathy towards women is evident in his books; simone de beauvoir spoke highly of him in 'the second sex'. she credited him for perceiving a woman as just a woman and simply a human being. citing stendhal's rebellious heroines, she maintained that he was a feminist writer. one of his early works is 'on love', a rational analysis of romantic passion that was based on his unrequited love for mathilde, countess dembowska, whom he met while living at milan. later, he would also suffer 'restlessness in spirit' when one of his childhood friends, victorine got married. in a letter to pauline, he described her as the woman of his dreams and wrote that he would have discovered happiness if he became her husband. this fusion of, and tension between, clear-headed analysis and romantic feeling is typical of stendhal's great novels; he could be considered a romantic realist.\n",

'the genuine triumph' of 'i puritani' in january 1835 in paris capped a significant career. certainly, 'il pirata', 'capuleti', 'la sonnambula', 'norma', and 'i puritani' are regularly performed today.\n",
