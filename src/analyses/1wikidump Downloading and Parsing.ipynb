Anarchism calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], which it holds to be unnecessary, undesirable, and harmful. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, placed on the farthest left of the [[political spectrum]], it is usually described alongside [[Communalism (Bookchin)|communalism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]] as the [[libertarian]] wing ([[libertarian socialism]]) of the [[socialist movement]], and has a strong historical association with [[anti-capitalism]] and [[socialism]].\\n\",\n",

       " b\"[[Humans]] lived in [[society|societies]] without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s, or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.\\n\",\n",

Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent, violent, or utopian.\\n',\n",

Anarchism calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], which it holds to be unnecessary, undesirable, and harmful. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, placed on the farthest left of the [[political spectrum]], it is usually described alongside [[Communalism (Bookchin)|communalism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]] as the [[libertarian]] wing ([[libertarian socialism]]) of the [[socialist movement]], and has a strong historical association with [[anti-capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. \\n \\n [[Humans]] lived in [[society|societies]] without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s, or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers\\' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more. \\n \\n Anarchism employs a [[diversity of tactics]] in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent, violent, or utopian. \\n {{toc limit|3}} \\n \\n == Etymology, terminology, and definition == \\n {{main|Definition of anarchism and libertarianism}} \\n {{see also|Glossary of anarchism}} \\n [[File:WilhelmWeitling.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Weitling]] is an example of a writer who added to anarchist theory without using the exact term.{{sfn|Carlson|1972|pp=22–23}}]] \\n The etymological origin of \\'\\'anarchism\\'\\' is from the Ancient Greek \\'\\'anarkhia\\'\\', meaning  \" without a ruler \" , composed of the prefix \\'\\'an-\\'\\' ( \" without \" ) and the word \\'\\'arkhos\\'\\' ( \" leader \"  or  \" ruler \" ).

[[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (\\'\\'[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]\\'\\') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (\\'\\'[[physis]]\\'\\').

Militant [[black bloc]] protest groups are known for clashing with the police;{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[anti-fascist]] action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}} \\n \\n === Evolutionary tactics === \\n Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]].

In contrast with the \\'\\'big-A anarchism\\'\\' of the classical era, the newly coined term \\'\\'small-a anarchism\\'\\' signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to [[classical anarchists]] such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}} \\n \\n The decision-making process of small anarchist [[affinity group]]s plays a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]] as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=119–121}} \\n \\n As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone [[online]] in the [[World Wide Web]] to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118–119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users\\' privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120–121}} \\n \\n Anarchists organize themselves to [[Squatting|squat]] and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and [[surrealism]] are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque]] atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|pp=37–38}} \\n \\n == Key issues == \\n {{main|Issues in anarchism}} \\n < !-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. -- > \\n As anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought; disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and communism|communism]], [[collectivism]], [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]), and the [[Anarchism and statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}} \\n \\n === Gender, sexuality, and free love === \\n {{Main|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex}} \\n [[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Émile Armand]] was a French individualist anarchist who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]] \\n As gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, many anarchists address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one\\'s autonomy imposed by gender roles.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}} \\n \\n [[File:AnarchaFeminism.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Collection of [[anarcha-feminist]] protests, symbols, and flags]] \\n Sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=178}} A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]] and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women\\'s sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[suffrage]] but were supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna2019|pp=166–167}} \\n \\n During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second wave of feminism]], radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a [[post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}} \\n \\n === Anarchism and education === \\n {{main|Anarchism and education}} \\n {|class= \" wikitable \"  style= \" border: none; background: none; float: right; \" \\n |+ Anarchist vs. statist perspectives on education < br > < small > Ruth Kinna (2019){{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=97}} < /small > \\n |- \\n !scope= \" col \" | \\n !scope= \" col \" |Anarchist education \\n !scope= \" col \" |State education \\n |- \\n |Concept || Education as self-mastery || Education as service \\n |- \\n |Management || Community based || State run \\n |- \\n |Methods || Practice-based learning || Vocational training \\n |- \\n |Aims || Being a critical member of society || Being a productive member of society \\n |} \\n The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as [[William Godwin]] (\\'\\'[[Political Justice]]\\'\\') and [[Max Stirner]] ( \" [[The False Principle of Our Education]] \" ) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222}} \\n \\n In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer\\'s approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]], who published the essay \\'\\'Education and Culture\\'\\', also established a similar school with its founding principle being that  \" for education to be effective it had to be free. \" {{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}} \\n \\n Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child\\'s right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1980|1pp=3–33|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=519–522}} \\n \\n Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ([[Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Colin Ward]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children\\'s creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism]] as part of a consumer society.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality.{{sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39–48}} \\n \\n While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England, and the Paideia School in Spain.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526}} \\n \\n === Anarchism and the state === \\n < !-- Important!

Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}} \\n \\n Specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. [[Robert Paul Wolff]] believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning  \" coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be. \"  [[A. John Simmons]] and [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.{{sfnm|1a1=Wendt|1y=2020|1p=2|2a1=Ashwood|2y=2018|2p=727}} Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.{{Sfn|Ashwood|2018|p=735}} \\n \\n === Anarchism and the arts === \\n {{main|Anarchism and the arts}} \\n [[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|\\'\\'Les chataigniers a Osny\\'\\' (1888) by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro is a notable example of blending anarchism and the arts.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}]] \\n The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{snf|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=493–494|2a1=Dunn|2y=2012|3a1=Evren|3a2=Kinna|3a3=Rouselle|3y=2013|p=138}} Anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Herbert Read]] stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592–593}} \\n \\n Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book \\'\\'Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas\\'\\', Chris Robé claims that  \" anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism. \" {{sfn|Robé|2017|p=44}} Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists ([[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Camillo Berneri]]) and publications such as \\'\\'[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]\\'\\' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|Miller|Dirlik|Rosemont|Augustyn|2019|p=1}} \\n \\n Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593–596}} The 19th-century [[neo-impressionist]] movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In \\'\\'Les chataigniers a Osny\\'\\' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]], the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}} \\n \\n == Analysis == \\n The most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot [[Self-governance|self-govern]] and so a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] supported this critique, stating that  \" [p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government. \" {{sfn|Krimerman|Perry|1966|p=494}} Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated [[anarchist federalism]].{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=78}} \\n \\n Philosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory. While it advocates for no-one to \\'\\'archiei\\'\\', if accepted by the many, then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory. In this line of criticism also comes the self-contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc= \" 4.

John Simmons]]\\' \\'\\'Moral Principles and Political Obligations\\'\\'.{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=Kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}} In \\'\\'The Problem of Political Authority\\'\\', [[Michael Huemer]] defends philosophical anarchism,{{sfn|Dagger|2018|p=35}} claiming that  \" political authority is a moral illusion. \" {{sfn|Rogers|2020|p=}} \\n \\n One of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority.{{sfn|Ferguson|1886}} [[Joseph Raz]] states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=37}} Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities\\' successful and mistaken instruction.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=38}} Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment.{{sfn|Gans|1992|pp=34, 38}} Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively.{{sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}} Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} \\n \\n [[Friedrich Engels]], considered to be one of the principal founders of [[Marxism]], criticised anarchism\\'s anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian.{{sfn|Tucker|1978}} Academic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] writes in his book \\'\\'Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism\\'\\' that  \" anarchism cannot win \" , believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}} The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.{{sfn|Baár|Falina|Janowski|Kopeček|2016|p=488}} \\n \\n == See also == \\n {{Portal|Anarchism|Libertarianism}} \\n * [[:Category:Anarchism by country|Anarchism by country]] \\n * [[Governance without government]] \\n * [[List of anarchist political ideologies]] \\n * [[List of books about anarchism]] \\n \\n == References == \\n === Citations === \\n {{reflist|25em}} \\n \\n === Notes === \\n {{reflist|group=nb}} \\n \\n === Sources === \\n ==== Primary sources ==== \\n {{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}} \\n * {{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|author-link=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Statism and Anarchy|title-link=Statism and Anarchy|year=1990|orig-year=1873|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England |series=Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought|translator-last=Shatz|translator-first=Marshall|isbn=978-0-521-36182-8|oclc=20826465|lccn=89077393|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139168083|editor1-last=Shatz|editor1-first=Marshall}} \\n {{refend}} \\n \\n ==== Secondary sources ==== \\n {{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}} \\n * {{cite journal|last1=Angelbeck|first1=Bill|last2=Grier|first2=Colin|year=2012|title=Anarchism and the Archaeology of Anarchic Societies: Resistance to Centralization in the Coast Salish Region of the Pacific Northwest Coast|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=547–587|doi=10.1086/667621|url=https://arcabc.ca/islandora/object/dc%3A312/datastream/PDF/view|access-date=24 June 2021|archive-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721142558/https://arcabc.ca/islandora/object/dc%3A312/datastream/PDF/view|url-status=live}} \\n * {{cite journal|last=Antliff|first=Mark|year=1998|title=Cubism, Futurism, Anarchism: The \\'Aestheticism\\' of the  \" Action d\\'art \"  Group, 1906–1920|journal=Oxford Art Journal|volume=21|issue=2|pages=101–120|jstor=1360616|doi=10.1093/oxartj/21.2.99}} \\n * {{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Benedict|author-link=Benedict Anderson|title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel|journal=[[New Left Review]]|volume=2|issue=28|pages=85–129|year=2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel|access-date=7 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219130121/http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel|archive-date=19 December 2015}} \\n * {{cite book|last=Arvidsson|first=Stefan|author-link=Stefan Arvidsson|year=2017|title=The Style and Mythology of Socialism: Socialist Idealism, 1871–1914|edition=1st|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0367348809}} \\n * {{cite journal|last=Ashwood|first=Loka|year=2018|title=Rural Conservatism or Anarchism?
