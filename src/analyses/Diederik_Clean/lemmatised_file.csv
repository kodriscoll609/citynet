Berlin,Leipzig,37,"Schopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813, fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia had just joined the war against France. He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month, disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig Muller von Gerstenbergk (1778-1838), a civil servant twelve years younger than her; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory. He settled for a while in Rudolstadt, hoping that no army would pass through the small town. He spent his time in solitude, hiking in the mountains and the Thuringian forest and writing his dissertation, ""On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason"". He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the Battle of Leipzig. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers in the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intention of remarrying. But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and nationalistic. His mother had just published her second book, ""Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805"", a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy.

In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the Brockhaus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well.

After the toxicity of arsenic became widely known, these chemicals were used less often as pigments and more often as insecticides. In the 1860s, an arsenic byproduct of dye production, London Purple, was widely used. This was a solid mixture of arsenic trioxide, aniline, lime, and ferrous oxide, insoluble in water and very toxic by inhalation or ingestion But it was later replaced with Paris Green, another arsenic-based dye. With better understanding of the toxicology mechanism, two other compounds were used starting in the 1890s.

Berlin,Nuremberg,563,"During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of ""Kristallnacht"" took place. Speer made no mention of it in the first draft of ""Inside the Third Reich"". It was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car. ""Kristallnacht"" accelerated Speer's ongoing efforts to dispossess Berlin's Jews from their homes. From 1939 on, Speer's Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer denied he knew they were being put on Holocaust trains and claimed that those displaced were, ""Completely free and their families were still in their apartments"".

Nuremberg,Berlin,564,"During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of ""Kristallnacht"" took place. Speer made no mention of it in the first draft of ""Inside the Third Reich"". It was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car. ""Kristallnacht"" accelerated Speer's ongoing efforts to dispossess Berlin's Jews from their homes. From 1939 on, Speer's Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing.

Strasbourg,Berlin,706,"From 1893 Schweitzer studied Protestant theology at the Kaiser Wilhelm University in Strasbourg. There he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor Gustav Jacobsthal, and associated closely with Ernest Munch, the brother of his former teacher, organist of St William church, who was also a passionate admirer of J. S. Bach's music. Schweitzer served his one-year compulsory military service in 1894. Schweitzer saw many operas of Richard Wagner in Strasbourg (under Otto Lohse) and in 1896 he managed to afford a visit to the Bayreuth Festival to see Wagner's ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"" and ""Parsifal"", both of which impressed him. In 1898, he returned to Paris to write a PhD dissertation on ""The Religious Philosophy of Kant"" at the Sorbonne, and to study in earnest with Widor. Here he often met with the elderly Aristide Cavaille-Coll. He also studied piano at that time with Marie Jaell. In 1899, Schweitzer spent the summer semester at the University of Berlin and eventually obtained his theology degree at the University of Strasbourg. He published his PhD thesis at the University of Tubingen in 1899.",1029,Albert Schweitzer,"['theology', 'instruction', 'piano', 'counterpoint', 'professor', 'brother', 'teacher', 'organist', 'church', 'admirer', 'music', 'year', 'service', 'opera', 'visit', 'phd', 'dissertation', 'piano', 'time', 'summer', 'semester', 'theology', 'degree', 'phd', 'thesis']","['theology', 'instruction', 'piano', 'counterpoint', 'professor', 'brother', 'teacher', 'organist', 'church', 'admirer', 'music', 'year', 'service', 'opera', 'visit', 'dissertation', 'piano', 'time', 'summer', 'semester', 'theology', 'degree', 'thesis']","['study', 'receive', 'associate', 'serve', 'see', 'manage', 'afford', 'impress', 'return', 'write', 'study', 'meet', 'study', 'spend', 'obtain', 'publish']","['study', 'receive', 'associate', 'serve', 'see', 'manage', 'afford', 'impress', 'return', 'write', 'study', 'meet', 'study', 'spend', 'obtain', 'publish']","['protestant', 'passionate', 'compulsory', 'military', 'earnest', 'elderly']","['protestant', 'passionate', 'compulsory', 'military', 'earnest', 'elderly']"

Vienna,Bucharest,726,"In 1879, Wilhelm Marr founded the ""Antisemiten-Liga"" (Anti-Semitic League). Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, Karl Lueger, the popular mayor of fin de siecle Vienna, skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.

Athens,Rome,981,"Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. It was a centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, and the home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum. It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent--particularly Ancient Rome. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece.
